            This website is a work in progress by
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													an anal cancer patient, diagnosed in May 2010 and treated in
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													summer 2010, with recovery pretty much reaching the "new normal." (It WILL happen!) The goal was to assemble as many resources  web-based and print  as possible,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													along with my own compilations on subjects such as side effects,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													based on my research, my own experience, and the experience of many
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													other patients sharing on the blogs listed on this site.  My own diagnosis was for the most common form of anal cancer in the US, a squamous cell anal carcinoma (SCAC), and most of the postings here relate to that form of anal cancer. Another form of anal cancer, cloacogenic carcinoma, accounts for about one-quarter of all anal 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													cancers. This cancer develops between the outer part of the anus and the 
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													lower part of the rectum, and as it begins in cells similar to the squamous cells, it is treated in the same way as SCAC. The very rare adenocarcinoma, developing in the mucus glands, may have more immediate surgery; but many of the issues associated with treatment of SCAC, such as the difficulty in discussing the diagnosis, also apply for these patients, and I hope they will find some parts of this site helpful. For more on the forms of anal cancer, see this

             overview

            from the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
           </p>
           <p>
            My cancer treatment center is not a research center and provided very little reference material. I
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													like and trust my doctors, and I realize that they do not have time
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													to pull together material for a cancer that is so rare they may
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													see very few cases in their professional lives. Their focus has to be successful treatment.  And, they are not patients.
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													 They have never experienced the treatment and its side effects. Some questions can only be asked- and answered - by patients! (Of course,
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/opinion/when-doctors-become-patients.html" target="_blank">
             doctors do become patients
            </a>
            - and have the same problems as the rest of us.) I have found from exchanges with other anal cancer patients that very few cancer treatment centers include any significant help for recovery and survivorship in their operations. So, I embarked on this website journey. The cancer experience is scary, even if you find it brings you gifts of understanding and gratitude for learning to more fully appreciate each day; David Rakoff explains this brilliantly in his essay,
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17lives-t.html" target="_blank">
             "The Waiting"
            </a>
            . It is less frightening if you do not have to go down this road alone.

            If you are newly diagnosed with anal

             HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation

            website. This site was created by the Almada family, children of an anal
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													cancer patient who lost her battle with this cancer in 2010.  It is
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													the only foundation dedicated specifically to increasing knowledge
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													and awareness of anal cancer, and promoting greater research
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													attention to it.  Please support them if you can.

             The foundation is always interested in hearing from anal cancer fighters and survivors: "We are currently collecting data from the medical community to generate a research agenda, we will share details of this when we have all the information. We would like to hear from you, the patients about what services you need, and how you think we can improve patient outcomes." You can reach them here:
             <a href="mailto:analcancerfoundation@gmail.com">
              analcancerfoundation@gmail.com
             </a>
             . The Foundation has also sponsored an online discussion about an anal cancer "ribbon," and you can download versions of the winning

             </a>
             . My favorite is the one with the motto "Kick Cancer's Ass!" The Foundation sponsored an inaugural internationl scientific meeting on anal cancer in 2013; see the report

            I am not medically trained, but hold a
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													Ph.D in political science from the University of Wisconsin.  Years of
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													study and publishing taught me the basic principles of good research,
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													and I have used that experience in winnowing through the internet and
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													the books on cancer treatment and survival.  The sites that I link to
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													are generally medical center websites, cancer research organizations
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													in the US and overseas (particularly the UK and Canada, which seem to
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													do less talking down to patients), and other sources of
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													information subjected to review and testing.  To the
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													best of my ability, none of these sites offer unproven or
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													irresponsible proposals for cancer treatment. Several colleagues from the Blog for a Cure (see the Anal Cancer Groups page) have provided extensive advice, which I've incorporated - thanks especially to Tyndall, herself a nurse, and Merrill!
