           First of all, is not about comfort. Since Ive started this quest, Ive never had safety, compensations or bonuses. On the contrary. Ive had days when Ive had to pretend to go to some important meeting, just because I havent got enough money to have lunch with my employees. And days when I went to bed at 1AM to wake at 4AM.

           Most people are so afraid of taking this step, perceiving entrepreneurship like a huge, bungee jumping. So, when youre around them, in the amusement park and see that youre going to jump, they are your fans. They secretly want you to be successful, because in their own hearts would love to have this courage.
