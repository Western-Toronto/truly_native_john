         For any business that provides a product or service to customers, the act of finding, targeting and obtaining new customers is always going to be among its top priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what many businesses tend to forget is that once a customer makes the first purchase, there is much more to be done in the customer relationship. Smart businesses know that the first purchase is really just the beginning, and that the real business value lies in retaining that customer.

        </p>
        <p>
         Leverage their most under-utilized assets  their employee base. Passionate, engaged employees can deliver personal customer experiences that create customer loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retailers can create that environment by developing a relevant and authentic employee brand that employees can connect with. The

          2013 Gallup study

         about employee engagement describes a U.S. workforce with only 30% of employees engaged in their work, with active disengagement costing the American economy an estimated $450-550 billion per year.
        </p>
        <p>
         More and more companies are looking to turn this tide and are taking advantage of their marketing resource closest to the customer  their employees  by giving their employees a reason to care, and clearly defining their mission and values and the role each employee plays in retaining their customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
         Truly engaged workers  passionate brand advocates to all they meet  are inspired by where the company is headed and are compelled to share that passion with customers by delivering great customer service and interaction. This connects the companys brand story from the inside out  from employees to consumers. When the brand experience is authentic and compelling at every touchpoint, youll create brand ambassadors within your own ranks that goes beyond 9-5.

          The first step to increasing customer retention is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Understand and measure why your customers or clients are leaving in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
         You cant solve a problem if you dont understand to what extent it exists or why it exists. Once that information is understood, the strategy is simple and should really be threefold:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Treat your customers/clients like people. The internet is a wonderful thing, but making an effort to relate to your clients/customers on a personal level is often the difference between a sustainable business and one thats here today, gone tomorrow.
         </li>
         <li>
          Appreciate your clients/customers. Thank you notes, thank you gifts for onboarding new clients and/or discounts to your most loyal customers can speak volumes. Even something so simple as recognition on social media for your most loyal customers can be valuable.
         </li>
         <li>
          Welcome and ask for constructive feedback. Let your customers know that their voice is heard. Dont wait for negative feedback to come to you, proactively reach out to your customers on a regular basis to find out what they like and what they think you can improve on.

        <p>
         <strong>
          In my experience, customer retention and loyalty can only be achieved when
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Organizations show strong employee loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Organizations that treat their employees with respect, give them the necessary tools to do their job and continually demonstrate that they are appreciated will see a workforce that will go the extra mile for the customers they serve. Unhappy, frustrated workers have little reason to put in the effort. Why should they? If employees dont feel valued, work becomes drudgery and customers are seen as just part of the daily grind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Simply put, an appreciated employee is a happy employee. And happy employees translate into happy customers and thus bigger profits for the company. The research shows this to be true:
        </p>
        <p>
         A Jackson Organization (now HealthStream Research) study shows that companies that effectively appreciate employee value enjoy a return on equity and assets more than triple that experienced by firms that dont.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here are simple suggestions on how to keep employees happy and providing great customer service:
        </p>
        <p>
         Acknowledging how your employees are doing something right is a far more successful path to work excellence, than pointing out what they are doing wrong. Psychology has long proven that people respond far better to positive feedback than to negative. By consistently letting your employees know what they are doing right, you keep employees on the right track since people are likely to repeat behaviors they have been praised for. This means less customer complaints and higher customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Check in with your employees to make sure they have what they need to do their job successfully. Giving your employees the right resources (whether training, equipment) improves their ability to provide customers with the services they expect.

        <p>
         <strong>
          The best way way organizations can improve customer retention is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         To foster better relationships with their customers by creating loyalty programs that provide two benefits:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          a frictionless user experience, and
         </li>
         <li>
          actionable insights for three transaction criteria: recency, frequency, and value.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Reducing friction is imperative. Faster throughput translates into real revenue. Merchants lose customers who have to go through several steps at checkout in the hope of having a better experience. Enterprises designing loyalty programs should use Apple Pay as a roadmap, as speedier checkout drives strong consumer adoption. Focus on eliminating every checkout hurdle you can, from check-ins to extra plastic cards and additional 2D code scans. Without consumer participation, retention programs dont work  regardless of the intelligence data available.
        </p>
        <p>
         With regard to insights, companies get distracted focusing on how to get more and more data. In reality, exceptional personalization and retention marketing thrives by avoiding the noise created by so-called Level 3 insights. Starbucks, for example, has designed one of the most widely successful retention schemes in the country. Customers receive incentives based on their visit frequency and lifetime value, not whether they bought a Venti Mocha Frappuccino or simple house blend.

        </p>
        <p>
         By focusing on the entire experience of their customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         While experts debate whether the marketing funnel is outdated, its been proven that managing the entire experience of any age of customer is a better way to keep customers. The conversation cannot stop once the sale is made.. It is critical that companies focus on sending personal communications throughout the lifecycle of the customer. In todays competitive environment, it is not enough to rely on service or repairs to hold on to customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, the welcome message is a critical  it is one of the single most important communications businesses can send. Customers are five times more likely to engage with you in the first 90-100 days than at any other point. So, its very important that you dialogue with them at the onset not just at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
         Technology allows you to adopt a Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) approach in a very cost-effective way. Personal customer microsites or creating personal URLs, or PURLs, are perfect for automating these types of communications. Using business rules, you can create relevant interactions by customizing the content for each customer. Companies that learn how to combine the power of the online world and their customer data to own the customer relationship have a much higher retention rate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Todays consumers are growing less responsive to mass marketing messages. Younger buyers are known for their skeptical and demanding attitude. Old-fashioned relationship building will never go out of style.

         Treat the act of keeping customers as important as it is to getting them!
        </p>
        <p>
         In the marketing world, retention is boring and optimization (especially around acquiring new customers) is sexy. The problem, I think, is too many organizations have been overly-inspired by Alec Baldwins classic Always Be Closing speech in the film Glengarry Glen Ross. I dont believe youclose a saleyou open a relationship. The sales transaction is the start of the relationship, not the end. Organizations would improve retention if they simply banished the idea of closing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Effective marketing is an equilibrium  its the equal balance of getting customers, and keeping them. If you only ever hear your sales and marketing teams talking about getting new customers, then theyre only doing half their jobs.

          When it comes to the best ways an organization can improve customer retention, they should first understand what customer retention really is:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Customer retention is a byproduct of customer service and experience. Create a good experience, thats consistent and predictable, and you have a shot at customer retention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The root of retention and loyalty comes service, which actually starts at the top, with the leadership determining if they want a customer-focused culture. That culture is what drives the customer experience. The way leadership treats employees drives the customer experience. The way employees treat each other drives the customer experience. In short, what is happening on the inside of an organization is felt by the customers on the outside. Its on the inside of the company where customer retention begins.

         Offer a simple way to pay.
        </p>
        <p>
         Too often, organizations will hyperlink to landing pages that then require you to fill out your billing and shipping information every time they purchase. Some require their customers to remember usernames and passwords or figure out annoying Captchas.
        </p>
        <p>
         The easier it is to pay or donate, the more people will do it. Organizations will capture a new revenue because the people who abandoned their shopping cart at that last step will actually be able to experience a frictionless, quick payment process. Retain those impulse purchases!
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, 39% of email recipients will read their email on a smartphone and then click through to the website. However, only 13% of those online transactions are actually completed (SeeWhy, 2013). They are dropping out at that final step.
        </p>
        <p>
         Payment technologies such as @Pay, PayPal, Vento, or GoogleWallet are simplifying the purchasing experience. Make your customers life easier and theyll keep coming back.

          The number one way organizations can improve customer retention is to

        </p>
        <p>
         Build the customer and not the sale.
        </p>
        <p>
         For businesses who are trying to sell their product, it is important to make a customer feel like they care about them even after they purchase. This will make all the difference in building a strong and lasting relationship with that customer. Building strong relationships is the most important driver when it comes to customer retention rates. If customers feel like they are just a sale, they will go somewhere else without a second thought. If they feel that they have built a relationship with a business, they are more likely to come back a second and third time.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the business side, it is important to keep detailed notes about your customers. If you have more than one person working on your customer service team and interacting with overlapping customers, they need to be able to communicate quickly and look at each-others notes. The worst thing you can do is lose a customer by not recognizing them as important.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you make customers feel important and spend time building relationships with them, you will have high retention rates over an extended amount of time. If you like your customers and your customer like you back, this also means that they are more likely to recommend your business to their friends.

         <strong>
          Getting customers to come back time and time again can be difficult, especially in a world of fierce competition and customer service stories being shared online. We live in a time where just providing a great product or service is usually not enough to keep them coming back. Here are a few ways companies can improve customer retention:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Give great service. Customer retention is fickle when customer service is lacking. Make sure the customer is dealt with promptly, courteously and efficiently. Listen to their needs and meet them as efficiently as possible. Customers will remember this, but they will remember bad service even more.
         </li>
         <li>
          Be quick to resolve issues. Not every product works exactly right and sometimes paid services dont meet expectations. Accept that when the customers expectations havent been met, you must work hard to make sure the issues are resolved to their satisfaction. They will remember this and they will feel like their purchases are safe with you next time.
         </li>
         <li>
          Keep in touch. Gather contact data on your customers when you can, and keep it current. Reach out to them with special offers or new products and services, or just send them a birthday card. Use any excuse to keep your company in their minds.
         </li>
         <li>
          Reward loyalty. Everyone, once in a while, should treat a loyal customer with a free product or special discount just for being a loyal customer. Youll be surprised at the goodwill this will engender.
         </li>
         <li>
          Thank your customers. Chances are you have competitors in your category and that means your customers have options. The fact that they chose you, whether or not because of your pricing or reputation or convenience, is something that you appreciate, so show it. Thank them. Thank them every time for choosing you and let them know in words and deeds how important your business is to them, regardless of whether theyre your smallest customer or your largest.
         </li>

         <strong>
          The best way for businesses to keep customers beyond their initial buy is to:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          serve people who are a good fit for what they have to offer, and
         </li>
         <li>
          to ENGAGE with them in deep, consistent, and meaningful ways.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         I feel like ENGAGEMENT takes exceptional customer service to a deeper level. From the moment a potential customer walks into your business or visits your website you want them to feel like theyve found their home.
        </p>
        <p>
         You need to speak to your ideal clients in the language that they speak and treat them like a new friend you are interested in getting to know better.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Marketing communications speak to them directly (using you). Welcome them by offering to share something of value ( a free download, first time buyers free shipping, a gift with purchase, etc.) with them ( just like you might invite a new friend to coffee and pick up the tab).
        </p>
        <p>
         Get to know them. Ask questions to find out more about what they like and who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make them feel appreciated right from the start. Do whatever you can to let them know that you appreciate their business and that they, personally, are important to you. Thank them on their way in and their way out of your physical or virtual store.
        </p>
        <p>
         Do what you do to the best of you capabilities (meaning offer your products or services with your signature style) and
        </p>
        <p>
         Follow up to make sure that your clients experience landed well with them.(send surveys, follow up with a phone call, or or just ask them, and dont forget to offer them a good reason to return)
        </p>
        <p>
         Continue to offer them incentives to visit you again (this doesnt necessarily mean you have to discount your products, free webinars, private shopping days, extended hours, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
         Heres the tricky part. You need to have some on-going way to stay connected when they dont need you. Offer a club for past customers and send them e-mails or offer phone calls, texts, or postcards to keep them aware of new ways you can serve them. Give them the option of being connected with in the way that works best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treat each of your clients like they really are your friend, one you care about deeply and want to get to know better and youll master the Engagement that will keep you in their thoughts and keep them coming back for more.

         Getting senior leadership and other key stakeholders to live the experience can help your team understand what your customers experience in their day-to-day lives.

         Yet, customer experience is something that has to be personally internalized. It must be caught not taught. Leaders who want to change the way people think or behave must recognize, encourage and deepen their teams insights through collaboration that creates shared vision and values.

         Stay in front of the customer on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every business has their own unique interaction with customers. Some have daily transactions, such as a coffee shop, while others connect on a monthly (mobile phone service) or annual basis (accountant).
        </p>
        <p>
         Within the cadence of interfacing with customers, there are opportunities to connect and offer a touch point. Marketing automation tools allow you to educate or inform customers or provide discounts towards other products and services. Developing a program that acknowledges customers during and after transactions as well as touches them on a regular basis enables organizations to stay in front of customers and remain top of mind.

        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
         Companies can begin by putting into practice, a process of asking for feedback, asking customers for candid reviews and basing important decisions on customer feedback. Communicating these insights back to customers gains trust and often involves social media and email marketing.

          There are many obvious aspects that factor into client retention. Its almost effortless to quickly make a list: Build rapport and trust, provide excellent customer service, and create open and honest communication between your company and your client. These examples are easy to do when everything is running smoothly. But its the time when the business relationship is not at its best when you can use the situation to your advantage. One area that is often overlooked when thinking about client retention is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Turning difficult situations into opportunities to earn your clients trust.
        </p>
        <p>
         When a client is frustrated or upset, it is a great time to show your dedication towards working with them to remediate the situation. Use this time to consistently follow up with them; meet with them in person, provide detailed status updates as your company works through the problem, and listen to them as they voice their opinions. Go above and beyond for them to show how much you value the relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes, its not easy to gauge when a client is silently dissatisfied with your service. Strategically use Customer Satisfaction Surveys. If a client leaves less than stellar feedback, schedule a meeting or with them or take them to lunch. Ask your customer for ways you can improve your relationship and work together on achieving those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the situation is resolved, make sure you continue to regularly go above and beyond for your client. Be proactive in the type of service you provide to avoid difficult situations in the future. When you and your client make it through a difficult situation together, it will increase their trust in your company. Most importantly, reflect on the situation and work with your client to build a positive, productive working relationship which will lead to client retention.

          In todays world, the returning business patronage is paramount to the success of businesses. Customers are looking for best practices, best prices, best return policies and ease of sales. We have noticed that the eCatalogs, online purchases, and in-store sales are still very strong. For companies looking to improve customer retention, we recommend
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Adding several key business and customer retention policies in order to maintain marketshare, using the word-of-mouth marketing methodology and rewarding the customer for being a loyal customer to your business.
        </p>
        <p>
         Below are proven suggestions:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Offer a Rewards Card to every Customer. Make them go to your website and activate the card. A time of application for the activation of your card you will receive valuable data: 1. Obtain name, 2. Cell phone number, 3. Email address 4. Optional physical address. With the following information you can direct market and email or text message your customer with an ever ties sales and/or keep your name out there so that they can identify with your company when in time of need of a specific service or product.
          </li>
          <li>
           As a part of your rewards program, we suggest you offer a 5 to 10% discount at the register while using the rewards card. Reward cards and loyalty cards offer a upgrade or eight upsell of service or product once they reach a specific percentage or number of times visiting your business. Or you can utilize point structuring based on the dollar amount that they spend in your store. This offers great tracking, uptick of sales year to year and then allows you to tweak it either add or subtract services towards your rewards policy program.
          </li>
          <li>
           It has been proven that creating a co-branded logo plastic reward card is a tangible item that the loyal consumer can bring out a time of sale swiping the information into your computer base register system and track their sales plus habits of items that we can perhaps seat for the future to market them.
          </li>
          <li>
           The educated consumer is all about finding best price, ease of service. We noticed that online sales are huge and if you offer either free delivery or wrapping services it is enough of a perk to stimulate added sales.

         To be proactive about the way you manage customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can do this by utilizing all the data you have to get a better understanding of your customers needs and wants. For example, if youre a SaaS business and you know that customers are constantly getting stuck at a certain point, you can create triggers that will automatically send them messages to walk through that issue. Ultimately, youll incorporate that feedback into the product to make sure customers dont get stuck. SaaS is different because almost all the interactions are digital and measurable but the principals of being empathetic to your customers needs remain the same, no matter what business youre in.

          I think there are really two key ways that businesses can retain their customers
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Improve their service.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is important. I recently spent time at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills and the attention to detail was extraordinary. Compare this to the way that my reservation at Loews in Coronado was bungled and butchered. Both organizations had the same information, in fact I had been in contact with Loews much more readily in the weeks prior to my trip because it was for pleasure, and they bungled the relationship. So by paying attention to details and doing little things to make my stay comforting, the Four Seasons maybe spent a few hundred dollars on improving my stay that will benefit them with several thousand dollars in extra annual income since my wife and I are on the road about 30-50 days a year for business and personal travelwhile Loews wont likely get the chance to win my business again.
        </p>
        <p>
         2. This second revolves around the first one, but I wanted to highlight it because its often overlookedand that is be responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my business, I try to follow up phone calls in 90 minutes or less during normal business hours and emails get a response in 24 hours. This level of responsiveness separates me from many consultants because my clients and potential clients dont usually call me because things are going well. So by being attentive, I show that I care and that simple action makes repeats and referrals much more likely.

          Adapt to their personality  Are they a socialite, a thinker, or a dynamo?

         <li>
          Uncover some sort of detail about them  For example where are they from? Oh youre from Boston? I was just there last month and ate at a great steakhouse called _______.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Connecting listening to customers to action.
        </p>
        <p>
         Already within organizations, theres knowledge of why customers have left or will leave. Prioritize talking with frontline employees, salespeople, and support people about customer complaints they hear. Also, review emails, letters and social media posts. Often, companies never dig deep into the root cause(s) of why issues are occurring. Even fewer implement solutions so it doesnt happen again.
        </p>
        <p>
         Try customer journey mapping with staff to understand the steps customers go through when interacting with your organization. It will help you identify operational and communication gaps to correct.
        </p>
        <p>
         If resources are limited a larger change, start with the smallest step that has the largest impact. If time is an issue, do 30 minute mini-training
         <br/>
         sessions once a week on a specific issue. If you cant afford a new website, hire a user experience consultant to improve the information and navigation on the current website. Making a mistake isnt an automatic loss of a customer, its not taking action on resolving issues that drives customers away.

          This is my advice to organizations who want to improve customer retention
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Customer retention is a mixture of art and science.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the art side, you need to be able to create and foster a meaningful relationship with all of your customers individually (in a B2B setting), putting in the required time and effort to go above and beyond what the customers expectations are.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the science side, its important for sales to coordinate closely with marketing to provide automatic follow up with the customer. Having consistent, useful communication with the customer is vital to establishing trust in your brand and guaranteeing continued business.

        <p>
         Be responsive.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         In an effort to reduce costs and to deal with a large number of customers (with minimal staff), organizations have tended to streamline their processes and train their customer service staff to give customers a pre-determined or canned response. There are companies who actually limit the amount of time a customer service representative can spend with a customer, regardless is the problem has been resolved or not.
        </p>
        <p>
         If organizations will spend a little more time training employees to provide an appropriate response and provide a resolution ladder, their customer retention will dramatically improve. A bad experience with a customer service representative is the top reason customers will chose another product or service from a competing company.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Implementing service contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
         To design the proper contract, a business owner needs to first understand the triggers that cause customers to contact their business, based on these three distinct customer segments:
        </p>
        <p>
         Segment 1  High value customers
         <br/>
         Segment 2  New customers
         <br/>
         Segment 3  Long-standing, loyal customers
        </p>
        <p>
         To determine those triggers, the company owner and at least two employees who interact with customers, should describe their last five customer interactions and the reason the customer contacted the business. Also determine why that reason was important, to dig down to the root cause that triggered the customer to interact with the company. Next, ask what would have prevented the customer from having to contact the business in the first place. This helps uncover the products and services that could be bundled into a preventative service contract. Next, speak with a group of 3 to 5 customers and ask them to describe the reasons they contacted your the business.
        </p>
        <p>
         After determining the reasons customers interact with the business, as well as what would have prevented the interaction, categorize similar responses by circling them in the same color (one color per theme). This will result in lateral thinking to find similarities and broader themes among responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         To finish the process, create a service offering that encompasses the majority of the reasons customers interact with the company. Also try to include at least four customer touch points (quarterly) throughout the year. Do not try to include everything. Its better to develop a service contract that would be highly desirable to 40% of customers, than to develop something that would be only moderately appealing to 90%.

        </p>
        <p>
         Meet unreasonable requests whenever you can.
        </p>
        <p>
         It sounds cliche, but the best retention strategy is a satisfied customer. For the web-based startups Ive built in my career its a clear and easy rule upon which all else depends. Young companies dont have the luxury of inertia  customers who have been using us for years simply dont exist yet. Plus, in most cases the defection to a competitor is a matter of a few simple clicks. We all know that a seriously disgruntled customer can have a vastly disproportionate impact on our brand when they choose to be vocal about their concerns on the net. But the opposite is also true: a seriously delighted customer can have a hugely positive impact if they choose to evangelize for us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a customers issue rises to the level of confusion or complaint, we go into satisfaction overdrive. It starts with understanding exactly what their expectation was and where we fell short, but continues into a pretty straightforward question: what would make *me* happy if I were them?
        </p>
        <p>
         Unreasonable and irrational customers happen  as do cheaters and free riders  but even meeting those unreal expectations whenever we can pays off in the long run. If unreasonable requests get too common or frequent, thats a great signal for us to make them reasonable  by building solutions into our product or service. As one of our mentors says, your most valuable customer isnt the one who buys the most, its the one who sells the most. And delighted customers make great sellers!

          As a realtor, sales people in my industry have a bad reputation similar to used car salesmen. But what the best agents in our industry know is that customer retention is all about referrals and eventual repeat business. There are two ways that the best agents achieve this:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The first is not to act as a salespeople but to act in a customer service role. We guide our customers through the process, giving them professional advice, and educating them along the way. We make sure that we are able to give the best service and information possible while guiding the customer through a stressful situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second way is follow up and offer something of value. We hear all of the time They were nice but they never got back to me. We need to follow up consistently throughout the process, after the closing, and keep people informed when they give us referrals to cultivate trust and forge bonds. When a customer thinks about Real Estate we want them to think about us. Its all about what we can do for the customer, not what they can do for us.

        <p>
         Hiring the right customer contact employees!
        </p>
        <p>
         The right customer contact employees are those with the perfect combination of knowledge, skills, personality and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my soon-to-be-released book, Hiring Right: A Business Blueprint for Lower Turnover and Higher Profits (Second Edition), I present a step-by-step process for doing just that. In addition to chapters on recruiting and screening, interviewing, checking references, legal issues in hiring, onboarding and new hire training, I cite dozens of examples and give tips and tools based on research and my experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, personality testing can help find employees who are the right match for customer contact jobs. In one company, a large regional bank, I helped reduce new-hire turnover of tellers from 95% to less than 30% by including a validated personality test as part of the applicant screening process. In addition to reduced turnover, customer satisfaction improved, transaction accuracy improved, and employees reported greater job satisfaction.

             If you ask people what the function of a business is, most will say to make money. Well, years ago Dr. Ted Levitt of Harvard Business school stated that the function of a business was to get and keep customers  not to make money. Making money is a goal. Without customers, you cant reach your goal. NG Data has given us a gift; 42 ideas that can help any company keep their customers.
