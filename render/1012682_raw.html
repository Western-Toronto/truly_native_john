If you're like me, chances are you had no problem reading that sentence. I'm sure you'd agree it's a slightly insulting sentence to say the least. But the truth is most people struggle to understand what it's all about, if they're able to understand it at all. Thats why I thought it might be helpful to create this l33t sp34k ch34t sh33t (or leet speak cheat sheet!) thatll help you cheat your way from n00b to l33t in no time.

      <p class="column">
       Almost a decade before

        Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web
       </a>
       saw its first light of day back in 1991, leet speak was born. Back then when the internet was coming up, most search functionalities simply looked for keywords in text to show relevant documents. Hackers weren't very keen on having their information displayed on websites, bulletin boards, newsgroups or any other place, so they started to replace certain letters in words. It started out with simple vowel substitutions like a 4 instead of an A, or a 3 instead of an E. This meant that topics like cracking or hacking remained undetected.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       One other (conspiracy)
       <a href="http://www.verbatimmag.com/27_1.pdf" target="_blank">
        theory
       </a>
       is that leet speak was invented as a way to beat automatic government surveillance programs, such as the legendary
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON" target="_blank">
        Echelon program
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In that period leet speak existed only in small circles, and was only used when necessary. It originated within bulletin boards, where someone having an ""elite"" status meant he or she was allowed access to file folders, games and chat rooms. But it wasn't until the addition of internet connectivity to one of the most influential titles in the video games industry,
       <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/" target="_blank">
        Doom and Doom II
       </a>
       that the use of leet speak exploded.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From there on leet speak evolved from a method to mislead search functionalities into a language for online gamers to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment. Phrases such as "1 4m 3l33t!" (I am elite!) were thrown around to demonstrate someone was an experienced gamer (or hacker).

       Leet speak alphabet
      </h2>
      <p>
       The leet speak alphabet in its simplest form substitutes vowels, but it can be pretty complex when substituting consonants as well. The table below shows several ways every letter of the alphabet can be replaced, starting with the most common substitutions at the top, moving to more fancy ones further down.

       Numbers and leet speak
      </h2>
      <p>
       It's not only letters that are substituted with numbers, numbers can be substituted by letters too. Although substituting numbers by letters isn't as common as the fore mentioned in leet speak. But for those of you who seek more obfuscation and frustration, the list below will definitely help you with that, and will probably help you get quickly accepted amongst the gaming community.

       Suffixes
      </h2>
      <p>
       In addition to substituting letters and numbers, more advanced leet speak uses various suffixes. In most cases this ads more complexity and thus makes sentences and words harder to read and understand. The most common suffixes are z's and ed's, that can simply be added to words like lol (lolz) without changing its meaning. Other more complex suffixes are described below.

       Abbreviations
      </h2>
      <p>
       Leet speak has come a long way since the '80s and has evolved a bit over time. This is especially true in online gaming, where you'll find a mix of leet speak and abbreviations. This too can be a bit confusing, since there are so many variations. Most of them are undoubtedly used in various chat rooms, instant messengers, Facebook, WhatsApp or any other form of digital communication. That's why some of the obvious ones are omitted to present you with only the more colorful abbreviations.

       As you've read above, leet speak is mostly substituting letters to a certain degree. The more you substitute letters, the more obscure it becomes. In addition leet speak, or more specifically a combination of leet and game slang, also has its own words and abbreviations. It's not always clear however, whether a word is meant as a compliment or an insult. That's where the leet matrix comes in, containing various common expressions together with their level of politeness and positivity. Words in the lower left section have a pretty negative meaning and are meant as an insult. However when someone uses a word in the upper right section, you're probably doing a good job.

       4 Levels of Leet
      </h2>
      <p>
       <b>
        You've probably noticed by now there's many different ways you can use leet speak. Ranging from basic vowel substitutions to really advanced combinations of various punctuation marks and glyphs. The way I see it, there's four distinct levels.
       </b>
      </p>
      <div class="column">
       <h3>
        Basic Leet
       </h3>
       <p>
        Basic Leet is nothing more than substituting every vowel for a number. This causes some confusion, but is actually pretty readable and understandable. So an A becomes a 4, an E becomes a 3, an I becomes a 1 and an O becomes a 0 (a zero). The letter U is an exception as there isn't an obvious number to replace it with. So in Basic Leet U's are either unchanged, or you can replace it with (_).
       </p>
       <h3>
        Intermediate Leet
       </h3>
       <p>
        If you've read any of the above carefully, you've probably already surpassed the Basic Leet level. Good for you! In that case the obvious next step is replacing consonants with either numbers or various punctuation marks. So in Intermediate Leet for example the letter B could be replaced by an 8, or by I3. Just like the letter G could be replaced by a 6 or a 9, or the consonant S by a 5.
        <br/>
        <br/>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Advanced Leet
       </h3>
       <p>
        Advanced Leet is where things get really exciting. Speaking (or actually writing) in advanced leet takes time to master, but guarantees people unfamiliar with leet have a hard time reading it. Advanced Leet is in fact a combination of Basic and Intermediate Leet, but uses punctuation marks for vowels as well. So instead of an A becoming a 4, it could become an @ or /-\.
       </p>
       <h3>
        Full Retard Leet
       </h3>
       <p>
        <!-- For all ber l33tz out there, there's the Full Retard Leet level, in which every vowel or consonant is replaced by alternating characters, punctuation marks and glyphs. So for example the letter A in one word could be replaced by a 4, it could be replaced by  or /-\ in another word.&lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;-->

       A word of caution
      </h2>
      <p>
       When you start off learning leet speak, it quickly feels like the only way to communicate with fellow gamers. However, using leet speak exclusively in forums, games or other chat rooms is mostly looked down upon. So it's best to just converse in normal English, and occasionally throw in some leet words or abbreviations. Thisll show others you truly are leet and not just some n00b who poses as a l33t.
