          112 Things You Need to Know About Buying and Selling Jewelry
         </h2>
         1.
         <strong>
          Know the value of your jewelry piece before you try to sell
         </strong>
         . If you know the value, you can ensure you get the amount the piece is worth. You should have your piece appraised by a professional appraiser before you attempt to sell.

2.
         <strong>
          Before you sell your jewelry, make sure to research your options.
         </strong>
         Most people feel more secure in selling to a reputable dealer. Dealers are often willing to pay top dollar for fine jewelry.

3.
         <strong>
          When buying an expensive piece of jewelry, always make sure to have the dealer give you information in writing
         </strong>
         and then

         <strong>
          Only purchase from or sell to a dealer who is listed with the Better Business Bureau.
         </strong>
         5.
         <strong>
          When selling diamonds or other precious stone jewelry, make sure you bring your certificates and appraisals to the dealer.
         </strong>
         This will typically allow you to get a better price.

6. Know how many carats of diamonds or other precious stones your piece has before you attempt to sell it.

7. Just because you have a genuine diamond or other precious stone does not make it valuable.
         <span id="more-1153">
         </span>
         8.
         <strong>
          Do not purchase from a dealer who does not offer a return policy.
         </strong>
         Reviewing the policy is extremely important before you make the purchase.

9. You should expect to be offered 25 to 30% less than the fair market value of your piece, unless you have an antique or one of a kind piece.

10.
         <strong>
          Look for a karat marking on all real gold jewelry.
         </strong>
         Be wary of purchasing gold jewelry without this mark.

11. When purchasing watches, research the most popular designers so you understand what designs appeal to your tastes.

12. You can test your gold jewelry by placing a magnet on the piece. If the gold is attracted to the magnet, it is not pure gold and has been mixed with other metals. This is an important tip for buying and selling jewelry.

13. Before purchasing a necklace, make sure you know the neck size of the person you are buying for. This can help you to know how low the necklace will hang when being worn and if it will fit properly.

14.
         <strong>
          If you are purchasing earrings as a gift, make sure you inquire about the purity of them.
         </strong>
         Costume jewelry is often made from nickel, which can cause allergic reactions in some people.

         15. A large diamond purchase should always be accompanied by certification lab, such as GIA or AGS documents.

16. If the diamond you are purchasing states it has had the clarity enhanced, this means glass has been added to the fractures. You should avoid purchasing these types of diamonds, as they can often break down and chip, especially during a repair procedure where heat is used.

17. When purchasing birthstone jewelry, find out what colors the birth stones are offered in. Many people are unhappy with the color of their birthstone and do not realize there are choices for some months.

18.
         <strong>
          Know how to care for precious jewelry before you make the purchase.
         </strong>
         Storing your jewelry properly can help to protect its value.

19. Never purchase a watch without finding out if a warranty is offered. The watch should have a warranty or at least some type of guarantee.

20. If you are purchasing jewelry as an investment, avoid purchasing based on emotion. Research your piece carefully.

21.
         <strong>
          Check with the Better Business Bureau and research the company before you purchase or sell.
         </strong>
         This can help you to avoid issues with your transaction.

22. Only purchase watches from a reputable dealer so you do not end up with a knock-off instead of a genuine brand.

23. Know the four criteria for the value of a diamond before you buy. They are: cut, clarity, color and carat.

24.
         <strong>
          Ask if the diamond you are purchasing has been treated to enhance its clarity.
         </strong>
         Lasers are sometimes used to treat diamonds. You should also ask if the enhancement will affect the value of the stone.

25. Ask the dealer if the gemstone you are purchasing is natural, synthetic or imitation. The dealer should be able to provide you with proof of the authenticity of the stone.

26. Pure gold is too soft for most jewelry. When purchasing gold, you can expect it to be mixed with other metals. Ask the dealer what metals are mixed with gold in the piece you are wanting to purchase.
         <div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1159" style="width: 266px">

         27.
         <strong>
          The higher the karat of gold, the more yellow it will appear.
         </strong>
         It will also be softer. These purer golds will need special care.

28. Some metals mixed with gold are acidic and can cause black streaks when a person who is sensitive to these metals wears them. This is not an indicator the piece is not real gold.

29. When
         <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/business/yourmoney/24money.html?_r=0">
          purchasing sterling silver
         </a>
         , you should see a marking of 925 on the piece, which means it contains 92.5% silver.

30. Those looking to purchase pearl jewelry should always check with the dealer to see if the pearl is natural, cultured or man-made. Natural pearls are created by oysters and cultured pearls are created by mollusks, with human intervention. Man-made pearls are entirely factory created and of much less value than natural or cultured.

31. You should always ask about the durability of the luster of your pearls before you make a purchase.

32.
         <strong>
          If you are purchasing a ring with a stone setting, make sure there are an ample number of prongs to hold the stone in place.
         </strong>
         The more prongs the better, so your stone is not lost.

33. Make sure to check the clasps on necklaces and bracelets. They should be easy to open and maneuver, but should also close tightly and securely.

34. In selling your personal pieces of jewelry, keep your emotions out of the sale. Many diamond pieces are sentimental to the owner and this can prevent you from selling your piece. Make sure you are emotionally prepared to part with your jewelry.

35. Obtaining bids from multiple dealers can assist you in getting the highest price when you are selling your jewelry.

36. When working with a gemologist, make sure they are listed on the American Gem Society website. This ensures you are working with a reputable gemologist.

37.
         <strong>
          If selling your jewelry online, make sure it is shipped to the company with insurance, so it is protected.
         </strong>
         38. If you have not worn a piece of jewelry in a year, chances are you wont. Consider selling the piece and pocketing the money towards jewelry you will wear.

39. Include the original packaging, pouch or box when trying to sell your fine jewelry. This can help to determine the value.

40. Do not have your watch refurbished before you sell. This will cause you to lose money on the sell and will not increase the amount you are given on the watch.

         41.
         <strong>
          Ask the dealer how they weigh your gold.
         </strong>
         You should pay in the same weight proportions as are used to measure your gold. If a dealer weighs in pennyweight, yet charges you by the gram, you are being paid less than your piece is worth.

42. Check the current market price of gold before you sell. Since this amount changes daily, it is always best to research before you start the selling process.

43.
         <strong>
          Read the fine print on your dealers policy for purchasing and selling jewelry.
         </strong>
         This will prevent surprises should you have issues with your transaction.

44. Clean your jewelry before you attempt to sell it. This will showcase the beauty of your piece and make it more attractive to the buyer.

45. When selling gold with gems, make sure you are given more than just the value of the weight of the gold. The gems in the piece should be priced separately, as they have value too.

46. Your jewelry is not considered an antique unless it is at least ninety years old.

47. Any piece of jewelry can be labeled as estate jewelry if it has been worn.

48. Do not attempt to sell your diamond engagement ring unless you are sure the relationship is over.

49. You will typically get more money selling your jewelry to an online dealer verses a brick and mortar buyer because there is much less overhead for the operation of the business.

50.
         <strong>
          Understand your jewelry piece value is not simply determined by the weight of the gold or the gemstones.
         </strong>
         If your piece was crafted by a well-known designer, it could be worth more than the projected weight of the gold alone.

51. Broken jewelry still has value. Do not be leery of selling your broken jewelry. At the very least, you can get the value of its gold weight in cash.

52. It is illegal to label jewelry as gold jewelry if it is less than ten karats in gold weight.

53.
         <strong>
          The length of the chain determines the type of necklace you are purchasing.
         </strong>
         A 16-inch is considered a choker, 18-inch is princess length and 24-inch or longer is opera length.

54. Pearls are listed as both round and baroque, which is a more oblong and dimpled shape. The classic look of pearls is normally found in the round shape.

55.
         <strong>
          If purchasing a gold or silver chain, ask the dealer if the chain is solid or hollow.
         </strong>
         If the chain is hollow, you will have to be much more careful in wearing it, as it can become easily damaged.

56. When buying a diamond, know the grading system for color. D-F is graded as colorless and perfect or nearly perfect. K-M is graded with noticeable yellowing in the diamond and should not be purchased for larger diamonds, as the coloring will be more noticeable.

57.
         <strong>
          Diamond clarity is important.
         </strong>
         Clarity is measured on a scale of FL or flawless to I2 or I3, meaning there are inclusions or marks that are visible to the naked eye.

58. The cut of the diamond will most influence its price. The better the cut, the more sparkly the diamond will be.

59. To save money on a diamond, choose S12 graded clarity, as this will have only slight flaws that are unnoticeable to the naked eye, yet will allow you to save a lot of money over other higher-graded diamonds.

         60.
         <strong>
          When purchasing jewelry for a gift, diamond stud earrings are always a timeless choice.
         </strong>
         They never go out of style and work with any jewelry taste.

61. When purchasing a watch for a man, always choose a larger face or the watch may resemble a womans watch against a mans larger frame.

62. 18 karat gold is often considered the strongest gold and is crafted with a percentage of 75% gold and 25% copper.

63.
         <strong>
          If you are purchasing gold jewelry as an investment, it is best to purchase during the Summer months.
         </strong>
         The price of gold jewelry is always greater after August.

64. For those interested in investing in gold jewelry, always purchase when the DOW/Gold ratio has risen above 49.

65. There are many factors taken into consideration when placing value on a piece of jewelry. Craftsmanship and detail are both important.

66. White gold is often coated with rhodium to give it a silver-like shine. Rhodium wears off over time, so these pieces must be re-coated periodically.

67. Unlike other metals, platinum jewelry is typically crafted in its purest form of around 95%.

68.
         <strong>
          The temperature the metal is cooked at will determine the hardness of the gold or silver.
         </strong>
         69. When having your jewelry appraised, always ask for the fair market value and not the value for insurance purposes, as this number is often inflated above fair market value.

70. When purchasing jewelry, make sure you understand the differences in price between retail, replacement, estate and liquidation values.

71. Never have your piece appraised by a jewelry store. They are very rarely able to be objective when it comes to giving a monetary value to your piece.

72. When purchasing an engagement ring, cut is the most important out of the four Cs (clarity, color, cut and carat).

73.
         <strong>
          When purchasing a diamond that has some color flaws, choose a yellow gold setting to make the diamond appear whiter.
         </strong>
         74. According to theknot.com, the average price of an engagement
         <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/diamonds-decoded-experts-guide-buying-engagement-ring/story?id=19630519">
          ring costs around $5,431.
         </a>
         Many people dont know this and make mistakes buying and selling their jewelry.

75. A carat is determined by the diamond or other precious stones weight and not its size.

76. Not all reports on diamonds are the same. Most reputable dealers recognize the Gemological Institute of America as being the most authoritative.

77. The Gemological Institute of America will not issue a report on stones that have had their clarity enhanced through non-permanent means.

         78.
         <strong>
          If the diamond you are purchasing has been enhanced, you need to find out if the enhancement is permanent.
         </strong>
         Glass fillings are not permanent and will eventually break loose.

79. When purchasing a watch by a well-known designer, make sure you get to know the designers trademark. This will help to ensure you are purchasing an authentic piece.

80. Always check the serial number when you are considering purchasing a watch. If in question, you can call the manufacturer and verify the serial number is authentic.

81.
         <strong>
          Ask the dealer if the colored stones in a jewelry piece are natural or synthetic.
         </strong>
         Even natural stones may have had their color enhanced, which is not always a permanent treatment.

82. When selling jewelry, it is typically easier to sell for cash outright than through consignment. In a consignment sale, your jewelry could be tied up for a long period of time before you are given payment

83. If you are considering a
         <a href="/sell_your_diamonds/">
          jewelry dealer
         </a>
         always ask for references. A reputable dealer should have no problem furnishing you this information.

84. Pictures are important when selling your jewelry. To get the best resolution, use the macro feature on your camera, to show more of the fine detail on your piece.

85.
         <strong>
          Ask for the credentials of the appraiser, buyer and dealer when making any jewelry transactions.
         </strong>
         86. When having your jewelry pieces appraised, ask if the appraiser uses certified Gemological Laboratory equipment.

87. Your jewelry piece will be valued based on the intrinsic value, rarity, desirability and condition.

88. Many antique and estate pieces are one of a kind pieces, which are normally given larger premium prices.

89.
         <strong>
          If your jewelry piece has been repaired, you can expect to receive less money in the sale.

         90. Do not feel pressured into the sell. Some dealers will give you what is called an only now price to make you feel pressured into a quick sell. A reputable dealer will give you time to consider your options and will stand behind the price quote given.

91.
         <strong>
          When selling to a dealer, you should not be charged for their appraisal process.
         </strong>
         92. There are ten common shapes when it comes to diamond solitaires. The round cut is by far the most popular for both rings and earrings.

93. Aside from the most popular round cut, the princess cut is the most popular of the non-round choices.

94. Diamonds should always be graded using a white non-reflective backdrop, as black tends to alter the perceived color of the stone.

95.
         <strong>
          Diamond faceting includes three basic cuts: brilliant, step and mixed.
         </strong>
         96. The cut of a diamond is sometimes referred to as the make.

97.
         <strong>
          When purchasing a diamond, the brilliant cut offers the most sparkle and is typically used in triangular or kite-shaped diamonds.
         </strong>
         98. The larger a diamond, the less brilliance it often has. This is because diamonds are typically cut to maintain their weight rather than produce the optimum brilliance in the stone.

99. When choosing a diamond for purchase, choose one that has an ideal to a very fine cut, for the most value. When you are buying or selling your jewelry, this is a great tip.

100. The pavilion depth of a diamond will determine how much it reflects light. If the pavilion is too deep, the diamond will not sparkle as much as a stone with a lower percentage of pavilion.

101.
         <strong>
          Tennis bracelets are the most popular choice for diamond bracelet styles.

         102. When purchasing a bracelet, make sure you know the approximate wrist size, as bracelets are sized.

103. Jewelry clasps come in: spring ring, lobster claw, box and toggle. Consider the recipient of the piece and their ability to operate the clasp. You should also consider the security the clasp offers.

104. Selling jewelry knock-offs or fakes is illegal. Make sure the piece you are selling is authentic.

105.
         <strong>
          When purchasing silver, avoid names like German silver or nickel silver, as these pieces have no real silver in them.
         </strong>
         106. Synthetic gemstones are not fake, as in made of glass. These are simply gemstones that have been grown in a laboratory.

107.
         <strong>
          If a jewelry deal seems to good to be true, it most likely is. Avoid getting swindled.
         </strong>
         108. Make sure your purchase receipt includes all of the information on your piece, such as weight, clarity, cut, color and other identifying features.

109. When shopping for jewelry online, make sure you know what you are being charged for. Ask about shipping charges as well as any other fees.

110. If you dont love it, dont buy it. Jewelry is a big investment and often has emotions attached. Though you should think clearly in your purchase, you also need to fall in love with the piece you are buying.

111.
         <strong>
          Sterling silver is always in demand and one of the easiest types of jewelry metals to sell.
         </strong>
         112. If you deal with an unethical jeweler, you may file a complaint with the Jewelers Ethics Association, a non-profit organization that works to support ethical business practices among jewelers.

       Rachel - I have been with the Diamond Banc since well actually going on almost four years now. I want to say they are for sure by the best to get loans for your Jewelry through. They will give you a better interest rate, and also they give you more for your jewelry. Way better then any pawn shop by far. Plus they also have the politest worker ever. Well, atleast at my local store here in Columbia, Mo. His name is Kyle Cook, and he is the best by far, and Know he didn't pay me to say that either lol! Also the do more then loan they even buy jewelry, watches, coins, and belive they do other things as well. Anyway  I love the Diamond Banc, because they have always treated me right, and thats why I give them a 5 star rating!!
      </li>

       <br/>
       Tooanh - I needed funds quickly but did not want to do a payday loan due to their exorbitant high, interest fees. Additionally it would also affect my credit score. I was first hesitant due to being out of state. However Kyle Cook's customer service, due diligence, professionalism, &amp; personal follow up was exceptional throughout the whole process from the quote, loan set-up, shipping, payment confirmation, etc. They certainly exceeded my expectations &amp; was always willing to work with you.
       <br/>
       I would HIGHLY recommend them and will use them in the future without a second thought if needed!!

       Toni - I had a diamond wedding ring with band to sell and I found Diamond Banc one of the first listed when I googled. I can tell you their services went WAY OVER expectataions on every level that I did work with them.  Not only did they respond in less than the 24 turn around promise, but they also followed with a personal phone call just to touch base.  They were quick, efficient with back up proof for their quote, and plesantly professional! I am a BIG fan of customer service with that real human personal touch and this company was all of that and more! I would HIGHLY recommend them and will use them in the future without a second though or search of another diamond buyer!

       D. - Top notch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I contacted several diamond buyers and Mills was obviously head and shoulders above the rest. He answered all of my questions, offered the best price, and will be earning my business in the future. Highly recommended.

       Courtney - Found a diamond and simply took it into the shop to see what we could get for it. This was very simple and easy! Great service and we got more than we were expecting for it.  I would definitely go there again!

       Kenny - The new Diamond Banc office is incredibly nice! Plus it's great that parking is now free and you don't have to fight for a spot downtown anymore. There isn't a better place in town if you want to sell or get a loan on your jewelry.
      </li>

       Google User - So much more than a place to sell gold!!! I took an old engagement ring in that I needed to sell and Amy was wonderful. She gave me the best offer I've ever gotten on it. And trust me I went to about 7 other places. She bought the ring as a whole instead of just for the center stone and gold weight. She was so nice and courteous and she knew what she was doing. I would recommend Diamond Banc to anyone that wants to sell their jewelry and get the best deal possible. Thank you Amy!!
