         Drop is the iPad-connected kitchen scale and digital baking assistant that helps you on your way to creating one perfectly yummy masterpiece after another. We sat down with CEO Ben Harris to discuss building the right team, working with PCH, and how the Drop team is hoping to change the way we cook.

          What is Drop?
         </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
         We re-imagined the kitchen by creating a connected cooking platform that centers around an iPad app. Weve got a pipeline of products that sync to that platform, and the very first one is
         <i>
          Drop
         </i>
         the iPad-connected kitchen scale, that makes perfect baking easy.

        <h3>
         <b>
          Where did the name come from?
         </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
         Jack, my co-founder, is brilliant with words and I think it was on one of the flights between Dublin and San Francisco that he put his thinking cap on. We were considering a few different names, and Drop really resonated because thats how easy it is to bake with: you just drop each ingredient in as you go along. Its also the shape of the product and its accurate enough to weigh a single drop.
        </p>
        <p>
         Coming up with the concept for Drop, there wasnt a single eureka moment. The whole team is very design driven, I am an Industrial Designer, Jonny is an award winning graphic and interaction designer and Jack and Tim have been working together for over 10 years developing creative technology projects. It was a real collaboration of looking at the heart of the home and seeing all value we could add.

         We work incredibly well together as designers. We started to talk about the kitchen space, and the different products we could develop. One of us said scale, and the reaction was, Wouldnt it be amazing if it did X, Y, and Z? From there we implement each one of those aspects, including the interactive recipes too. Weve made a huge leap with Drop, but there is much more to come!
        </p>
        <p>
         Were incredibly excited about getting people back to the kitchen and back cooking again. The kitchen is ripe for innovation right now and there are so many data points that we can give people that will help them to be a better cook.

         Im an industrial designer by trade; I studied in Brunel University just outside London. Thats where I was developing products to remove ambiguity from the kitchen, such as a perfect egg boiler that made perfectly hard or soft-boiled eggs, and a meringue maker that made meringues using a vacuum instead of heat. Its a space Ive been interested in for years. From there I went on to
         <a href="http://www.leckey.com/" target="_blank">
          James Leckey Design
         </a>
         , a company based out of Belfast that develops postural management equipment for kids with special needs. They are among the top two or three companies in the world that make equipment for kids with special needs. I was there for four and a half years, where I led product development right from sketch all the way up to mass production, where we were shipping products globally. I sent hundreds of components to mass production in China. My office there was based in the assembly line in Belfast too, so I got a huge amount of experience in getting products ready for mass production. If I made something difficult to assemble, the guys knew where to find me!

         Back in Dublin, I have a MakerBot and that really helps facilitate the hardware part of things. Jack and Tim are our electrical, software and firmware specialists, that know their way around a hardware hack. They took apart a few scales, got a few Bluetooth modules and pulled them all together. We put them inside a little 3D-printed case that we made and started to develop the app.

          Why did you choose to go to Highway1?

        </h3>
        <p>
         A couple of people that I know I have manufacturing experience asked me this. Then I wondered why I didnt feel I could do it myself. Its because Id done it myself that I knew what value
         <a href="http://www.pchintl.com/" target="_blank">
          PCH
         </a>
         could bring, and what
         <a href="http://highway1.io/" target="_blank">
          Highway1
         </a>
         could bring. It was the perfect fit for us because we are designers and technologists, so we want to keep developing products. We dont want to be running around the backstreets of China getting all the products together. We know PCH is doing an amazing job of that, so the company is a perfect commercial partner for us.
        </p>
        <p>
         One thing that didnt play into the decision to go therebut was actually one of the huge pluses from itwas the camaraderie with all the other teams as we went through the program as well. Weve learned a lot and made a lot of great friends along the way.

        <p>
         We had been in the depths of development for so long from Dublin and then onto Highway1 and this was the first time we announced the products and the company to the world. We were on stage in front of 3,000 people and we got that wow response that we were hoping for. Its greatto get that response from two or three people when we show them the product, but getting it when youre in front of 3,000 is amazing.

         Highway1 really facilitated a lot of that. Weve got put in touch with
         <a href="http://highway1.io/team/madeline-duva/" target="_blank">
          Madeline Duva

         , who has been a great advisor to us. She found our acting V.P. in marketing

          Alice Chan

         , who really understands the tech startup space but also has her own
         <a href="http://alicedishes.com/" target="_blank">
          food blog
         </a>
         and really loves the food space. She was our unicorn of a marketing specialist to get involved. We now have a core team of six based out of Dublin, thats our back end development team. Our front-facing company out of San Francisco is an extended team of four or five. Some are contractors and some are full time.
        </p>
        <p>
         If youre looking to build a great team, you need to find people with similar interests to yourselves. You dont need to have identical personalities, but make sure that you complement each other. Our team has been put together pretty serendipitously, were like family; I think thats the important thing. Make sure that the team that you do start to work with are people that youre happy to be sitting there in the trenches with. Weve found people everywhere.

         We always got connected through the community. It was my brother that connected me to the rest of the Drop crew, and then we found

         through Twitter. We picked up some great people along the way, and I think once we do build up that rapport with them, they integrate nicely. It was more down to Tim and Jacks integration in the creative technology scene in Dublin that gave us a huge connection there.

          What was your experience like going to the factories in China for the first time?
         </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
         I went over to China with my two co-founders Jack and Tim back in March of last year. It was the first time we had all been, it was to see a company that we had built a rapport with and had been communicating with for a year. Through those emails you dont have an understanding of what that company is or how established they are. They came to meet us at the ferry port and there was a very young-looking guy ready to collect us. He looked about 18 and he picked us up in what looked like his dads car.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all shared a glance with each other thinking, What have we gotten ourselves into? Luckily, we got to the factory and it was actually a brilliant company to work with and we got some great components and expertise from them as well. Well hopefully work with them into the future. It was great that the team went back in November with Highway1.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a hell of an adventure. I think thats why we built a rapport with PCH very quickly at the start, because they understood that wed gone out there before, done it ourselves, and tried to make our own path.

          What made you decide to go to China to check it out?
         </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
         We just said, Lets get on a plane. Lets just go out there. Lets stop arsing around. There were email exchanges that were going on for six months back and forth.
         <a href="https://twitter.com/liamcasey" target="_blank">
          Liam Casey
         </a>
         convinced me to just get on a plane and get out there. When we ended up finally going there, we got a huge amount done in two days.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third time I went was a real whirlwind. Time was tight with a lot of stuff going on here. I ended up flying out of San Francisco and getting into the Four Points Hotel in Shenzhen at three oclock in the morning. I had a nine oclock meeting the next morning, where I met Liam, the engineering team, the packaging team, the media team, and the electronics team in meeting after meeting. After that I had a great lunch with Liam where we got a chance to shoot the breeze. Then back for more meetings in a jet lagged deliria. I was in a taxi back to the airport at 8pm that evening. I was on a plane back to San Francisco within 20 hours of landing in China.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amount of work we got done was ridiculous. It would have taken a month of time for that information over email. It makes a huge difference to just get on a plane and get out there. If people go out there, I would recommend they make sure they dont just see PCH. Immerse yourself in the culture and enjoy their food. Respect their culture as well. Its very different to the American way of things and I think its important to respect their way of doing things.

         Ive had blinders on for the last six months while working on Drop. Weve had our heads down on everything Drop-related, and if its not within our line of vision right now, it doesnt get to see the light of day. Im sure there are a couple of things that are great out there, but Im the type of person that focuses clearly on getting to that next goal. Im looking forward to lifting my head for the next few weeks.

         Not enough. Every so often I have some really nice moments when I need to pinch myself. Like when I went to Maker Faire. That was somewhere Ive wanted to go to for years and then I was right in the middle of it demoing Drop.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every time Im in China I have one of those moments. I try to remind myself to look up and absorb it and make sure Im enjoying it. It happened in New York a little while ago, again. I dont do it enough. Im usually just flying along on this conveyor belt and I need to make sure to just look up every so often. Every time I do it really gives me a huge amount of energy.
