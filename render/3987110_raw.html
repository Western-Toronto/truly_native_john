         Antibiotics are medicines that
         <a href="http://www.nps.org.au/medicines/infections-and-infestations/antibiotics/for-individuals/what-are-antibiotics-and-how-do-they-work" target="_blank">
          fight infections or diseases caused by bacteria
         </a>
         , such as colds, flu, and pneumonia, as well as things like urinary tract infections, skin infections, and wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         But while taking antibiotics is a powerfully effective way to treat many ailments caused by bacterial viruses, the downside is that taking antibiotics may do more harm than good, because with each time you take them, you
         <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/antibiotics.html" target="_blank">
          increase the chances that bacteria in your body will be able to resist antibiotics
         </a>
         . As a result, you could later get or spread an infection that antibiotics cannot cure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since Del Immune aims to provide the best natural products and solutions for many types of health issues, we wanted to learn more about safe alternatives for antibiotics. More specifically, we wanted to learn tips from health experts on what they would consider to be the best natural alternatives to the use of antibiotics that would give our immune systems their best fighting chance against bacteria and infections. To do that, we asked 22 health experts the following question:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          What is your top, natural alternative to using antibiotics?
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Weve collected and compiled their expert advice into this comprehensive guide to natural antibiotics alternatives. See what our experts said below:

          My top alternative to antibiotics is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         To bolster your immune defenses and avoid getting sick in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are all exposed to bugs on a daily basis and not everyone gets sick. Some may just get the first indication of a sore throat but it disappears by morning whereas others exposed to the same bug could be laid out for weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         The obvious question here is how do some escape getting sick. There are a number of reasons why your immune response may be sluggish and some easy to fix solutions.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Get at least 7 hours of quality sleep nightly
         </li>
         <li>
          Minimise stress
         </li>
         <li>
          Clean up your diet, minimise the takeaways, sugars, soft drinks, alcohol and coffee
         </li>
         <li>
          Eat 3 servings of fruit each day to provide Vitamin C and anti-oxidants
         </li>
         <li>
          Consume 5 different coloured vegetables each day for a variety of vitamins and minerals
         </li>
         <li>
          Top up zinc and selenium, essential constituents of immune fighting cells, to fortify your
         </li>
         <li>
          immune barrier.
         </li>
         <li>
          Consume adequate protein daily to build immune cells.
         </li>
         <li>
          Zinc and vitamin B6 are needed to synthesize protein to make immune cells.
         </li>
         <li>
          Echinacea with extra zinc and powdered vitamin C (3000-4000mg per day) taken at the first sign of a cold can help the body muster a strong immune response and fight off the bugs quickly.
         </li>
         <li>
          Dont try to push through, listen to your body and get rest when needed.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Clearly prevention is better than the cure. Relying on the quick visit to the doctor and prescription of antibiotics time and time again can have consequences for your future health. Personally, Id rather not get sick in the first place.

          My top, natural alternative to using antibiotics is:
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         For years we have always kept colloidal silver on hand in our house as our antibiotic of choice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Colloidal silver was used as an external, topical disinfectant before there was antibacterial soap. It is still used to kill bacteria and can be safely used internally as well. In ancient times it was used in wound dressings. Churches use silver chalices in Communion to stop disease spreading through the congregation. It has been considered a universal antibiotic and is effective against not only bacteria, but viruses and fungi as well. It has a very long, well documented track record.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another thing I love about it is that it doesnt destroy the good bacteria in the gut like other antibiotics will, nor will it cause antibiotic resistance so common today and has become a serious problem. The important thing is to use wisdom and common sense  choose a high quality brand from a reputable source and use it as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several years ago there was a story about what they called the blue man who said he took large amounts of silver daily and his skin turned blue. Well we have to get out of this mindset of, if a little is good, a lot is better. More isnt always better  or necessary! We generally only use colloidal silver internally at the first signs of a cold or flu and as a mouth rinse after dental cleanings when the gums are tender and more open to bacteria. There are some excellent silver tooth gels and also topical gels that are great for rashes, acne, cuts, scrapes or any skin problem.

          With the cold &amp; flu season in full swing, its good to keep a couple of natural remedies on hand to keep your body healthy. By using a natural remedy that you likely already have in your kitchen, you are helping your body to heal itself, without the scary side effects of prescription medicine! Any of these natural remedies can be used both inside and outside the body  add them to your meals, buy them in capsule form, or simply rub on your skin
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Coconut oil
          </strong>
           this versatile oil is anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, anti-viral it really does it all! It can be used for cooking, baking, and also applied topically to help correct almost any skin condition.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Essential Fatty Acids (EFA)
          </strong>
           these help to reduce inflammation in the body, and can even help to reduce the severity of an allergic reaction. You can find EFAs in fish oil, flax (oil and seeds) and walnuts.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Cayenne Pepper
          </strong>
           this wonder spice contains a compound called capsaicin, which helps relax muscles. This can be helpful to rub on a muscle cramp. Taken internally, cayenne can help with digestion, and relieve cold and flu symptoms by helping to break up mucous.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Garlic 
          </strong>
          this kitchen staple is best when the fresh cloves are crushed  this releases a compound called allicin, which has similar properties to penicillin. This can help obliterate toxins, bacteria, fungus, and viruses from your body.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Honey
          </strong>
           has been used for centuries by civilizations all over the world  it is considered one of the best natural antibiotics. Make sure to choose raw, unpasteurized honey, because pasteurization destroys most of the healing effects.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Try one, or all, of the above remedies for whatever ails you, and feel good that you are helping your body to heal itself naturally.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         I like to focus prevention first. Add essential preventative measures during the flu season. Step up the probiotic intake. As we all know by now, 70% of the immune system is in the gut. Get your nutrients naturally. Your natural winter cravings for vegetable soups and broths are guiding you in the right direction. This is a good time for citrus and stone fruits, so get your vitamin C the tasty way. Keep the hand sanitizer close. If that cold or flu hits: its all about rest and fluids. The flu runs a course, and you want it to run its course as quickly as possible. But if you feel it has taken a turn for the worse, always check with your care physician.

         Yarrow, Oregon Grape Root , Juniper and Artemisia.

         Since there is an exponential growth curve of organism resistance like MRSA, health care professional should use natural herbal plants as antibiotics. There is overwhelming evidence that many plants have anti bacterial, anti fungal, anti viral, and even anti parasitic properties.

         </strong>
        </div>
        <div>
         Coconut oil.Its know to be antiviral and antibacterial due to its high concentration of lauric acid, a medium chain triglyceride. Other than in coconut products, lauric acid is relatively uncommon except in breast milk. Use coconut oil topically on cuts, scrapes, and sores; as in a rinse in your mouth instead of mouthwash (also known as oil pulling); or include in smoothies to help boost immunity. Lauric acid is available in supplement form if you are trying to treat a specific ailment and require concentrated doses.

         I love using essential oils like oregano and DoTerras OnGuard.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can put the oils on your feet at night or take them internally via a veggie capsule. Oregano Oil is antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal. I also use Olive Leaf extract if I feel a cold coming on. Its available online in a liquid or capsule. Ive used each for years and Im always available to stop a cold before it gets too bad.

          An antibiotic is usually prescribed by a physician to treat some form of infection. I dont tell my clients to go against their physician, but I do counsel my clients to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Ask their doctor if it is necessary to take that particular medication, weigh the risk to benefit, and if there is another recommended holistic option.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rise of antibiotic use has been associated with negative side effects, mainly destroying the good bacteria along with the bad. Whenever I am not feeling well, or the cold and flu season is on, I increase my intake of vitamin C and water. If I, or a client is recovering from an illness, then the intensity of a training session will go down. High intensity training may be more stress than the already compromised immune system can handle. I would start with more stretching, breathing exercises, light body weight movements, and then increase to more intensive strength and endurance training as they feel better.

         <strong>
          My recommendations for natural alternatives to anti-antibiotics has several parts:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The real issue with an infection is not the bad bug but the weak immune system of the person. Therefore strengthening the immune system has to be the focus.
        </p>
        <p>
         This includes; plenty of sleep and fluids, top quality broad -spectrum nutrition which includes digestive enzymes and pro-bio tics to assist the absorption of nutrients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Foods I recommend for supporting and strengthen the immune system are whole raw garlic, apple cider vinegar, raw honey, organic coconut oil, bay leaves fresh citrus fruit and fresh organic fruit and vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are millions and millions of bacteria in the living world, we need them for our survival and health. In the bigger picture it makes little sense to kill them ofand is dangerous in several ways. It slows the development of the immune system, so weakening the bodys resistances AND strength ens the resistance of the bacteria as they evolves.

         <strong>
          This is my advice when it comes to natural alternatives to antibiotics
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Avoid the need for antibiotics! Treat yourself right with good foods and clean habits. By increasing your vegetables and decreasing chemicals, allergens, and processed foods, you allow your immune system to remain strong and protect you.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you do get sick, allow your body time to heal. Warm teas, sleep, and hot soup give your body the heat and hydration to expel bacteria and viruses naturally. When choosing tea, you can pick something with peppermint, ginger, or marshmallow (the herb, not the candy!).
        </p>
        <p>
         And do remember to stretch! Your lymphatic system needs to move around stretching and/or light exercise can help your immune system stay fresh and strong. Light exercise also increases your internal temperature, helping your body become too hot for bacteria.

        </p>
        <p>
         Whenever I feel like I am getting sick, even if its just the slightest warning sign, I eat three or four bulbs of garlic. Not cloves..bulbs!

         I might eat it straight, put it in soup or put it with something else, but eating it raw is definitely the best way to go. This has absolutely worked for me for years and I swear by it for me. And its much cheaper than antibiotics! Although the thought of this option might not be pleasing to everyone, I can assure you that it is a much easier, better and tastier solution than you might think.

          This is my advice for those looking for natural alternatives to using antibiotics
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Intelligent fasting allows the body to dispatch all stored energy and nutrients to self-heal any condition. Our immune system administers 24/7, processing bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses and non-nutritive materials found in the body, even dead body cells. Immune cells are garbage collectors, ingesting anything left in our tissues, like cell waste products not removed by lymphatic drainage. This includes microscopic pests gratified by the garbage. The immune system represses unwanted populations of microorganisms, which are opportunistic creatures, living in the environments of our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some microorganisms are beneficial and some are not. Beneficial ones help assimilate plant and animal foods, traveling in the gastrointestinal tract. Some virulent ones can also gain entre via the gastrointestinal tract. Others infiltrate the body through the lungs or a cut in the skin. All these unwanted microorganisms pester the brain. Killer immune cells are sent to fend off these unwanted deleterious invasions. Microorganisms have important jobs; they are not evil. When you cook carrots and leave them out in the air, a mold will develop. This mold is bacterial action, breaking down the decaying carrot. Its Natures way of recycling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Animals are hungry for energy and nutrients while digesting food. The immune system uses energy and nutrients to work, to function. Supporting the immune system means, get plenty of energy and nutrients. Energy and nutrients are sensitive to light, heat and oxidation. Human are the only animals to cook food. Do cooked apricots have more utilizable energy and nutrients than uncooked apricots? When an animal gets sick or injured, its not hungry. Its more interested in healing.
        </p>
        <p>
         For this reason, I advocate limiting or stop eating all together, until the healing crisis passes. Rest and drink plenty of water; it works wonders. Im not completely against antibiotics, most of the time, they are unnecessary.

        <p>
         Garlic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Garlic is natures antibiotic, and was used religiously by many ancient civilizations to fight off all kinds of nasties. The allicin in garlic is a powerful compound that is know to have antimicrobial properties. To benefit from the healing properties of garlic, chew a raw garlic clove (yes, gross, I know), up to 3 times a day. The chewing action is what releases the allicin and makes it most effective. I have known people who have recovered from illness such as strep-throat using garlic instead of antibiotics.

         We do like natural antibiotics, but they work only for the right indication, similar to how Cipro is useless for tooth abscess but Penicillin wont really help a UTI. Weve found oral oregano supplements useful in skin and anti-fungal agents, but natural antibiotics such as tea tree oil an be caustic if used improperly. In general, competitive approaches (meaning that harmful bacteria cant grow because helpful ones are competing for resources) work better, and at appropriate doses probiotics are better tolerated than trying to wipe all the bad guys out.

          This is my advice to those looking for natural alternatives to antibiotics
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Always trying alternative medicines, my father that was a Cancer Surgeon (the classic rebel), I did mostly use liquid garlic many years ago. When I became a mum (now 20 years ago) that question became a bit more important.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a mother, ear infections, teeth swelling, bruises and fevers were the normal course of parenting  so what to use when Panadol doesnt work or my normal go to alternates. More research was my answer PLUS understanding what was really happening to my son.
        </p>
        <p>
         A fever  well that means hes trying to get rid of an infection or his burning off a virus  check for infection in the chest  not there? Then no antibiotics. I find mostly people turn to antibiotics when they are desperate to just kick the flu etc. but we weaken our immunity to everything else. PLUS its mostly a virus in any case, so check if it is first. Ive hardly used antibiotics and when I have, I feel quite sick on them  so I avoid at all costs. My Chinese therapies of acupuncture can definitely help, plus a good dose of hot water, lemon, Manuka honey and ginger is a winner. Yes Ginger is the antibiotic of the Eastern World.
        </p>
        <p>
         Viruses are the biggest problem we have approaching our time. My father who used to lecture at the university about this, used to say We have spent thousands of years accommodating the common cold, with genetic modification happening, weve created a whole new world of viruses that will be are only enemy in years to come. He said this to me 20 years ago  and he was truly right. So best protection from viruses is to always try and avoid depleting our natural antibiotics/flora in the body and use an antibiotics when ALL ELSE fails.

          What is your top, natural alternative to using antibiotics? is difficult to answer as there are a variety of herbs to use for specific conditions. What one would prescribe for a throat infection will be different from what is prescribed for a urinary tract infection. But I will say is that
          <br/>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         As a practitioner or Traditional Chinese Medicine, overuse of antibiotics are unnecessary when good herbal alternatives are available. An acupuncturist can prescribe herbal prescriptions with no serious side effects. For example, herbs that clear heat (fever), dry dampness (pus), eliminate toxicity (infection) and have antibacterial properties work extremely well.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Chinese materia medica, many antibacterial herbs contain berberine, naturally found in herbs and used in China as a broad-spectrum anti-microbial medicine. These herbs include huang qin (Radix scutellariae), huang lian (Rhizoma coptidis), huang bai (Cortex phellodendri), long dan cao (Radix gentianae) and ku shen (Radix sophorae flavescentis). Anti-viral herbs may also include antibacterial activity, and formulas including herbs such as jin yin hua (Flos lonicerae), lian qiao (Fructus forsythiae), pu gong ying (Herba taraxaci), ban zhi lian (Herba sciutellariae barbatae), da qing ye (Folium isatidis), ban lan gen (Radix isatidis), chuan xin lian (Herba andrographis) and yu xing cao (Herba houttuyniae) to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many people have had great success with herbal medicine without destroying healthy bacteria, interrupting the bowels, or depleting the immune system.

         This is difficult, because it begs the question why are you being prescribed antibiotics? That being said probiotics are usually the answer most times. Many people have poor probiotic status because of prescribed medications and poor food choices. Once you get the beneficial microflora back in balance, the immune system can fight most battles!

         is a medically friendly natural therapist who believes your emotional immune system is the foundation of your health and well being. When you work on this piece of the puzzle, you find that your jigsaw starts to look a whole lot shinier than before.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          When it comes to natural alternatives to antibiotics, it is essential to understand that
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The emotional immune system being affected will then deplete the bodys immune system. Its essential to work with the two immune systems together, so when the emotions are understood, then addressing what you are eating and how thats depleting your immune system should also be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         Natural antibiotics such as echinacea, zinc, colloidal silver, and a probiotic will also support the bodys ability to heal itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         I stress though, this is a process to work through. If antibiotics have figured heavily in your life, do the emotional work now and during the next time you require them to see if your health returns more quickly, and then investigate food intolerance and natural alternatives as a process back to quality health.
