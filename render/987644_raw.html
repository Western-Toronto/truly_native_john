           The past catches up to Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Dont take this wrong way ... he began.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She raised her eyebrows, her golden-brown eyes laughing at him, wondering what foolishness he was going to offer next.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... but, I dont think Im in love with you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           This was an awkward moment. Her mouth snapped shut to punctuate it.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She tried to sit up, but he placed his hand on her chest and eased her back onto his pillow.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           You didnt let me finish, he said. I dont think Im in love with you. I know I am.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She couldnt help smiling. She surprised herself, but she felt relief.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Really? she said and squinted as if scrutinising him, but they both knew that she had given herself away.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Is this what it means to be speechless, he said after a moment, or are you just not that impressed?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im shocked. I wasnt expecting ... that. Weve only seen each other ... how many times?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Whos counting? he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Six times, he thought. Weve known each other for nine months and weve made love nine times, on six occasions. Weve made love in this room four times. Once in the en-suite bathroom. Once on the stairs. Once in a guest room at a party thrown by the Hunters. Once in the Sheraton Hotel. And there was a four-minute episode on the kitchen counter, which couldnt really be called making love, but should count for something.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What were you expecting from me? he asked.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           A limousine, she said after a moments thought.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Women never let you forget.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I would have driven you home myself last night, he said, but I had an important dinner to attend and you ....
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... dont eat meat, she finished. I know. Anything you say, Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           And its not a limousine, said Jack. Its a Mercedes Benz. Limousines are for hen nights.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           And I suppose Joes not your chauffeur, but your Interpersonal Delivery Professional.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe is my security man. I trust him to get you home safely. He's a black belt in something I can't even pronounce  though you have more subtle ways of getting people onto their backs ...
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... cheeky  
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... my point is that thats why he goes everywhere with me, and consequently with you too. Lets not talk about that anymore.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Fine. Its in the past.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           And so is my good mood. I was telling you that I love you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I know those words dont come easily to you. In your book, were practically married now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Bola, I wouldnt expect you to marry a sloth like me. All I'm saying is that this is the closest Ive ever come to wanting to spend my life with anyone, let alone a woman. As selfish as it makes me for wanting it, despite what it will do to you, I want you to be with me.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He had often told her that he had nothing to offer her. He hadn't been talking about shoes or bags or weekends in Paris. There was plenty of that. He was talking about his soul. There wasnt much of that left. If he spread it any more thinly, he feared that reality would start to show through.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He didn't think that she understood him, until now. Perhaps she understood him too well, because she wasnt saying anything.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           If you wont marry me, he suggested, perhaps youd accept my proposal to go to the theatre on Thursday evening.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Bola sighed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She swung her legs out of the bed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She sat with her back to him, her skin dark and smooth. There was no colour she could not wear. He, on the other hand, could not wear green or red or orange or any bright colour. Black contrasted his very pale, white skin. When he wore white, he disappeared. Joe sometimes jokingly referred to him as Hopkirk (Deceased). Against the white sheets, he looked like a sick, old man. Against the same silk sheets, she sat like a fall of butterscotch on a bed of ice cream.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Weve gone from marriage to the theatre in 60 seconds, she said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Frankly, Bola, I was trying to let you off the hook.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im a fish, she observed. Her eyes took on a far away look. She seemed to be searching for something. Thrown back into the river for someone else to catch.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           If its any consolation, Im the worm.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           No, she said. No consolation. And no surprise.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She gave up her search, stepped into her skirt and pulled it up over her calves, over her knees, over her hips.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I didnt mean to hurt your feelings, he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Ultimately, it doesnt matter whether you meant to hurt my feelings or not. The point is that I have feelings and you always hurt them.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im sorry.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Me too.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           As Bola buttoned her blouse, Jack's phone rang. She scowled at him when he answered the call and gestured for her to wait.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack, said the voice on the line, its Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Not now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           This is important, Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Listen to me. Okay? Not now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Bola was already slipping into her grey business jacket. The hiss of cotton against wool. She checked the cuffs, giving Jack a few more seconds to decide what was important.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Your wifes here, said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... So? said Jack. Make her a Mule. Hold back on the ice.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I think she may already be drunk, Jack. Shes on the roof.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           To Bola now, holding out his hand, pleading: Wait! Two minutes. Promise.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Bola hissed and folded her arms. That would do. Jack backed into the en suite bathroom and closed the door.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Shes doing what?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Shes not doing anything. Shes sitting there.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Sitting where?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           On the roof.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           On this roof?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           On the pool house roof.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Christ. Ill be able to see her from here.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What do you want me to do?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What I want you to do, Joe, is to stop people climbing onto the pool house roof. That would be good.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Well, if I could know everything and be everywhere at once, and if in those circumstances I was still under your gainless employ, I would certainly have done that. As it is, Im phoning you to let you know. In the absence of time travel, what would you like me to do?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Do nothing.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Do nothing?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Nothing.

           Jack, I think shes serious. I think shes going to jump.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I might get a new pool on the insurance.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ...
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           If she jumps, call me. Is the cook here yet?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           You mean Cristina. No, shes not here yet.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Okay. Bola's leaving now. Take her out the back door. Okay? He pressed the end call button before Joe could reply.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im sorry about that, he said as he returned to the bedroom.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Important call?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           An emergency. Where were we?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I was leaving.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Right. This didnt go the way Id expected. Why dont we take a few days and then pick up later in the week?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not one of your business engagements. We dont pick up.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Thats why I suggested Thursday. Its the one day I can be completely free. No phonecalls. No meetings.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           No meat.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Not a burger in sight. I promise.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Stop saying promise. Its making me nervous.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           There was a breeze from the open window and he realised that he was naked. Her scrutiny went beyond his chest, his abs, his penis. It cut through his damp skin. He felt as if she was watching his heart beat.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Thursday, she reminded him.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           One more thing, he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           A sliver of light came through the curtains and lay like ribbon on the side of her face and shoulder. She was beautiful, smart, sexy, funny, cool, and she was trying not to smile again.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What is it? she said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           All he had to do was tell her what he really felt for her, with no caveats or escape clauses. He wanted to tell her that he didnt want her to leave, not today, not ever, and while that might not mean much to her, it meant a lot to him, because hed never felt that way about anyone or anything before.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Ill have Joe pick you up, he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Youre an utter shit, said Bola and then her head exploded.
          </p>
          <p align="CENTER" lang="en-GB">
           *
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack hit the ground on his arse, rolled and crawled towards the bed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           When he opened his eyes, he saw that Bola lay twisted on the floor. Her position was much the way it had been the night before, following their love-making, arms thrown up over her head, hands abandoned, except now she was fully-dressed and there was a hole above her right eye. Both her eyes were open, glazed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           To break contact with her he intended to glance at the wall, but once he looked at it he couldnt look away for a long time, because it too was sprayed red. There was blood, brain and skull on the wooden floor. A piece of brain slithered into a crack. He was staring at it when the phone rang again.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Shes got a gun, said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I know she has a gun, Joe. I can see that. I can see that all over the bedroom wall.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Oh my God, are you okay?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im rolling around in Bolas fucking brains, but Im fine. Im great Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Okay, calm down. Stay away from the windows.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe. No more advice. Please. I need to talk to her, but I cant let her see me. I want you to go over to the pool house, climb up onto the roof and give her your phone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im waiting for the punchline.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Shes not going to shoot you, said Jack. She thinks youre cute.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im probably not the person to be doing this. We should call somebody.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           You can wait for police to show up, but in the meantime she will have blown her own head clean off ... He glanced at Bola, shouldnt have. Or jumped. You said yourself that she was going to jump. Do you want that on your conscience? No. So get over there. And call me back.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           End call.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He sat with his back against the bed, staring at what had been Bola. The blood puddle was growing around her like a terrible halo and the pattern on the wall was forming rivulets and collecting on the skirting board.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Fuck me, he said out loud. He closed his eyes and when he re-opened them the world was still on its side.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He had seen this coming. He was the only one who knew the severity of his wifes instability. Or rather him and her black market pharmacist, named Stig, but Stig didnt know she had access to firearms. If Stig had known that she was a police officer, he would have shat.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The police psychologist, Dr Silver, had recently written her an uplifting report, saying that she had made good progress and had shown significant improvement in a number of key areas. His wife knew which boxes to tick.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack had been the only one who could have seen this coming and prevented it. One out of two just wasnt good enough.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Fuck me, he said again.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The phone rang.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           News, demanded Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She didnt shoot me.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Where are you?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im on the pool house roof.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Give her the phone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She says she doesnt want to talk. She wants you to come out.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           No shit. Give her the phone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She says that the only way shell take it from me is from my cold, dead fingers. I believe her. Also, her hands are kind of full right now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Explain.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She's holding a rifle with a telescopic sight.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Tell her to put the gun down and then Ill come out. He listened intently as Joe relayed the message.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The curtain billowed, ghost-like.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She says that we must think shes an idiot, that youre not listening and that if I dont get down, shes going to change her mind and shoot me in the face.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Tell her not to overreact.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not passing on any more messages, Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Okay. Put her on speakerphone then.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not sure this is a good idea.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Do it.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Okay. Hang on. We can both hear you now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren, Jack said. He tried to sound strong, but his voice was shaking. Youve killed somebody.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Her voice was often mistaken for husky and her manner demure, but he saw her for what she really was: empty and emptier now than ever. He heard it in the hollowness of the words she uttered in response to his distress.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I know, she said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Why?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Wrong place. Wrong time. I didn't know she'd be here.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Where are the kids, Lauren?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           In the car.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Wheres the car?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           In your driveway.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Are the kids okay?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Why the sudden interest?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Because youre not behaving like a model parent right now.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe reminded Jack that he was still holding the phone, be it at arm's length.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Its a little late for parental concern, said Lauren.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I thought you said she was drunk, said Jack. She doesnt sound drunk.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           That's it. Im taking you off loudspeaker, said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Wait! Lauren, lets not make this any worse than it needs to be. Damage limitation, babe. Remember that? Its not too late for you to get out of this. Did you miss your medication this week? Did you take too much? We could say it was an accident. We can plead ... that thing.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Diminished responsibility.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Yeah. That.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Youd know all about that.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Or maybe temporary insanity.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I can see your bedroom door Jack. I can see the brass doorknob. I can see the blood. I can see the bedside table. The white lampshade. Theres blood on that too. I can see her underwear. She was in a hurry, but she left those on purpose. I think that's why I killed her. I'm not sure.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Youre a cold bitch.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im leaving, said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           One thing first, Lauren said, while I have your attention. I do have your attention, dont I?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           You have my undivided attention, said Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not talking to you, said Lauren. Im talking to Joe. Im going to tell you something, Joe, and its going to hurt. Its going to hurt a lot. I know, because it happened to me too. You remember the night your wife called you to say that it was over. She was crying. She said she was calling from a payphone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... I remember, said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She was calling from Jacks phone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren! Jack said. Thats enough.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           How long were you married Joe?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... Eleven years.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Theyd been seeing each other ...
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren! No!
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           ... for ten.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           There was no clear voice on the line for a long time after that. Jack strained to hear the gist of the muted exchange between Joe and Lauren.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe, he yelled. Dont listen to her! It's the pills talking. She's trying to turn you against me.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He put his own phone on speakerphone and crawled towards the window. He knew that he shouldnt, that she would put a bullet through his skull at the first opportunity, but he was desperate to see what was happening over on the pool house roof. He pulled back the curtain, imitating a gust of wind and peeked out. He saw a shape opposite and ducked back before he could really register what he had seen.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe, he yelled into his phone. Listen to me...
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joes gone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What have you done?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I told the truth. Now hes on his way over to hear it from you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Well done.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Hes very upset. That's two people in one day who are very upset with you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Thank you. Thank you very much. Youre a fucking -
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Ten years, Jack, she said. That was your longest lie. Do you feel relief that it's almost over?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Why are you doing this? He could have lived his entire life and not known. What was the point?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           There was no point, not as far as he's concerned, she said. Im just using him to flush you out.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack scrabbled over the floor to his side of the bed, balls slapping against his thighs. He retrieved a key from the book cabinet by the wall and unlocked the bottom drawer of his bedside unit. The other, he recalled, was splattered with blood. He imagined scrubbing it, repainting it, giving up, throwing it out and buying a new bedside unit, a new bedroom, a new house.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He pushed aside emergency money in dollars, euros and sterling, his British passport, a platinum necklace, and retrieved a hardback Good News Bible. It was light, not only because he had hollowed out the pages between Acts and Jude with a knife, but because the handgun that was meant to be nestling inside was missing.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           A trickle of sweat ran over his naked spine.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I gave it to Joe, Lauren said. Its a close-up weapon.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           You cunt.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Charming.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack snatched a dressing gown from the back of the bathroom door and wrapped it around himself, tying it tightly at the front. If he was going to be attacked or killed, he didnt want the police investigating the incident while he lay on the floor with his cock hanging out. Hed gleaned enough about police procedure and crime scenes from Lauren to do this completely without irony. He dropped his phone into a pocket before returning to his hands and knees and padding like a dog to the bedroom door. It was his only way out. He took a wide berth around Bola. Her blouse had soaked up a lot of blood, which had fanned out from the wound. As he approached the door, he couldnt resist a look at the mess of the back of her head.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He hurried then, shaking, anticipating metal in his spine as he did so. Avoiding the blood on the door as best he could, he yanked the handle, pulled it open and ducked out of the room, closing the door behind him and dropping to his knees again, expecting wood to splinter where his head had been moments before. Instead, Laurens voice came from his pocket.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I underestimated you. I thought youd lock yourself in the bathroom. I didnt think youd be out of there in under half an hour.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He started down the stairs, his bare feet slapping against the cool white steps, when he saw Joes outline through the glass of the front door. He wondered how long it would be before Joe got in and how much visibility of the rooms Lauren had from her vantage point.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           That Lauren was a good shot at any distance was regrettably unquestionable. Her skill at work had been her downfall. That and good or bad luck. She was always the sharp-shooter who had the clear shot; always the one who returned to the armed response unit having fired her weapon.

           Nine months ago, she had killed Samuel Leigh, a Politics Professor from Golders Green, who had lost everything he owned and some things he didnt on the stock market. He had locked himself, his Head of Department, a female work colleague and his family  his wife and three children  and also the au pair, who had been about to clock off for the evening, in their home for nine hours. Lauren had ended the siege. Her shot had smashed the front room window, where the professor had fleetingly aimed his pistol towards a police vehicle. The bullet from her rifle caught him in the neck, passing through his throat, exploding his windpipe, and lodging in the chest of Kara, his nine year old daughter. Sammy as he had been affectionately known in the staff room, had died on the front room rug. Kara died in hospital nine hours later, effectively drowning in her own blood.

           Everyone has a bad day at work.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Nine, Lauren said, was her unlucky number.

           The shadow at the front door twisted the handle as Jack stumbled back up the stairs, heading for the service door at the rear of the house, which was accessible via a tight stairway. At the bottom of this was the pantry. The stairs were dark because the pantry door was shut. He always asked staff to keep it closed so he couldnt hear pots and pans being thrown around in the room beyond. There was a solitary electric bulb hanging above, but he descended in darkness, because turning the light on might give away his position.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Why are you going that way? Lauren asked from his dressing gown pocket. Her voice rebounded against the walls.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack fumbled for the speakerphone button.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I can hear your breathing, Lauren said. You sound like youve been running. Are you scared, poppet?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           After months of complaining about the noise, Jack found himself at the pantry door straining to hear anything on the other side; the sound of leather soles on tiles; breathing; a gun being cocked.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He couldnt stay in the stairway all day, as much as he felt like curling up in the dark and wishing that this wasnt happening. He had to move.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He turned the handle, edged open the door. He eyed a figure in the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Cristina was chopping tomatoes. She was surprised to see him using the service stairs. To her, he had always materialised and dematerialised in one of two locations; the dining room or the bedroom.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The back door has always been your favourite way out, Lauren was saying.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Fuck. Off.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Cristina dropped the salad spinner.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Not you Cristina. Not you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He put a finger to his lips and she gave him her coy smile, which became a giggle when his dressing gown fell open.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Now? she asked, undeterred by his gestures for silence. Here?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Not now, he said and strode towards the exit.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He found himself jogging past the chopped tomatoes and the water boiling on the stove and the coffee bubbling in the pot. He unbolted the rear door at the top and the bottom and pushed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The setting sun threw golden light across the kitchen, dazzling him. Although it was dangerous in the open, he was glad to be out.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Like a rat out of its cage, he thought.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Emerging amid black bags, he shielded his eyes against the sun's glare.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The compact car was probably parked beside the tennis court. He tried to remember if you could see the court from the pool house roof. He hadnt given it any thought before. The romantic view was in the opposite direction. He might have paid more attention to what else lay around him if he had been less concerned with seduction whenever he was up there.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He was about to peer around the building when Lauren stepped out from behind one of the large wheelie bins by the rear wall. She was in uniform, blue shirt and navy trousers, bullet proof vest. Her ID badge twinkled in the dying light, as did a set of handcuffs on her hip. Her boots thudded on the grass as she approached, his Glock in her gloveless hand pointing towards his chest.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Dont, he said. Please. With his hands in the air, he felt like he was being robbed rather than killed, his life another possession to protect.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She stood about ten paces from him, her copper-wire hair tied back in a bun. Her eyes were grey and cloudy. The gun was pointing at his chest. His only hope was to talk his way out of this, the way he had talked himself in and out of dangerous situations for years.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I want you to think about what youre doing, he said. His voice came out of the telephone receiver in her hand.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She hung up.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Youre making a mistake that youll regret for the rest of your life, he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Been there, she said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           That girl's death was not your fault. You didnt see her. No-one could have. She was crouched down, hiding. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could have happened to anyone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           But it didn't happen to anyone, it happened to me. And Im not even talking about her. I know I cant do anything to fix what happened that day. I cant put those lives back together. But I can fix you. I can remove you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           What about the kids? Jack said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Are you scraping that barrel again, Jack. We're no good for each other. And we're no good for them. What I'm doing really is damage limitation. Joe will protect them. He's like that.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Jack lowered his hands.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           That wasn't Joe at the front door. That was you.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Yeah. I told Joe to take the kids. I don't want them here for this.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           They need their father!
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Like a hole ... in the head ...
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           For a moment, Jack thought she was going to turn the gun on herself. He held his breath, hoping, but -
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Crack!
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           - the first shot hit him in the chest. He staggered back a few steps, surprised. His body surged with panic, but he had time to wonder if he would survive this when a second bullet hit him, higher than the first. He went down on his back and slid down the bank. He attempted to snatch a lungful of air and screamed a wet scream.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The sky wasnt quite clear. While the clouds had made life more interesting, this was dying and different criteria applied.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Quick? Yes.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Painless? Yes please.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Interesting?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The wind blew his dressing gown open. He sighed. He hadn't the strength to close it.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Laurens face appeared in his field of vision. While he was thinking about his final moments in this world, shed let her hair down. The glowering sun now caught the edges, making them glow. She was beautiful in the end, even though she didnt smile, even though he hated her more than he'd ever loved anyone.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Goodnight, Jack.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She levelled the gun at his nose. The muzzle flashed.

           Joe slowed Lauren's jeep to a crawl because two police cars were speeding towards him from the opposite direction, whooping sirens and flashing lights, blinking headlights. As they passed, he saw that the driver of the first police car was fat and calm, while his partner significantly slimmer, younger and more agitated. He was holding the radio to his mouth but visibly screaming for the motorists to get out of their way. The cars were followed by an ambulance and then, a minute later, another police car.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Wheres mummy? the girl asked.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She had to go and do something, Joe told her.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Well, yeah, duh, but where?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Joe looked at the flashing lights in the rear view mirror.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not sure, he said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           When will she be back?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Seven years for murder? Ten?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Ill take care of you, he said. I promise.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The girl sighed.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The little boy looked at his sister, but she was stony-faced.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Is mum going to the place where bad people go to? the boy asked.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Prison? said Joe.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           No, the boy said, and looked at Joe as though he was simple. Hell.

          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren was sitting on the grass with her back to the house when the first of the policemen came to see her. He was so young.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Hi, Hussein, she said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Hussein took in the bloody body on the grass nearby.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Hes dead, Lauren said, doing his job for him.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Put the gun down, Lauren.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He was approaching very slowly and she laughed, watching him advance, as if she might explode at any moment.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Stop, she said when it wasnt funny anymore.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           I dont know whats going through your head right now, he said, but theres always a way out. We can talk about it, but I need you to put the gun down.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He was talking to her as though she was an idiot. They had all been doing it. No wonder hostages got shot.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He crept another step forward.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Hussein! Cut that out.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           The big red door beside her was open. Inside, Hussein could see a kitchen with a central worktop suspended from the ceiling by silver poles. On the orange tiles sprawled the body of a woman in a beige print dress, her head bent back against a cupboard door.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren? Hussein said. What happened?
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           She couldnt tell whether he was talking about the crime scene, in which case, he should stop expecting handouts, or, more likely, whether he was talking about her state of mind, after she appeared to have been doing so well. She had given all the signs of having made breakthroughs in one-on-one and group therapy sessions with Dr Silver. Nobody would have expected this.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Later, some would probably argue that she had been insane after all, but she knew that her decision to kill Jack was the only thing that had kept her sane. Now it was done and so was she.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Turn around, Hussy. I dont want you to see this.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not turning around.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">

          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Im not going to turn around, Lauren.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Lauren put the gun under her chin.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           No!
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           In her mouth.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           Think about your kids, Hussy said.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           If you won't turn around, she said, say hi to Doctor Silver for me.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He refused to turn. A few seconds passed between them. When Lauren put the gun back into her mouth and squeezed her eyes shut, Hussy looked at his boots.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           He flinched at the gunshot.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           In the hollow space that the noise created inside and around him, he heard Lauren's body slide down the wall. He didn't look up, not even to make sure that she was dead. He didn't see the mist of blood hanging in the air, floating towards him on the wind.
          </p>
          <p lang="en-GB">
           If she had survived, she'd have said:
