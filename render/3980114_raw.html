         Women spend a lot of time worrying about their butts. Its too big, too small, too saggy, too wobbly, too firm, or too floppy. And, for most women, the butt obsession boils down to one vital question: How to get a bigger butt?
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, strap on your seatbelt and get ready for the ride because youre about to jet off to Brazilian butt paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we turn our, admittedly envious, eyes towards Latin America, we see a different story. And when we zoom in on the Portuguese speaking portion of that continent, we start to get a little booty jealous. Thats because the ladies in Brazil have got it going on when it comes to the perky posterior. Its not just the swimsuit models either. The beaches of Rio De Janeiro are awash with hot, sexy butts  and they belong to women of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, just what is the Brazilian secret? Is it purely that these women possess superior glute shaping genetics, passed down from their Aztec forebears? Or is there more to it than that? Is there anything that these Brazilian beauties can teach us about how to get a bigger butt?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Fortunately, there is.

         It just so happens that Brazilian women place an inordinate measure of importance on their rear ends and demonstrate it by the emphasis that they place upon them when prioritizing their workouts. In fact, its not uncommon for Brazilian women to spend 30 minutes every workout session solely working the muscles of the rear end. And that butt workout isnt thrown in at the end of a 45 minutes chest and back session. No  the entire workout is just for the butt.
        </p>
        <p>
         The secret, then, of how to get a bigger butt is no secret at all. Its simple plain old common sense. To get a great butt youve just got to work your butt off. But youve got to do it smart.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smart, in this case, means prioritizing your workout so that you are putting all of your energy and focus into your rear end, rather than adding it as a tag on after exhausting yourself on other body parts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smart also means correctly utilising the elements that comprise an exercise program designed to re-construct your butt. You need to provide a sufficient workload and a progressive strength overload in order to give your butt a reason to change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smart means realising that a moments pleasure in the mouth can lead to a lifetimes regret on the backside. Controlling what you eat is a critical factor in reshaping any part of your body, but especially your rear end. Thats because women have more trouble firming up the butt than any other portion of their body. Women tend to accumulate fat in the rear end, and it is, in fact, the first place where fat storage will build up on a womans body. It is also an area of the body that is prone to cellulite  that dimpled, lumpy look  accumulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smart means realising that you cant spot reduce fat from any area of your body. By controlling your nutritional practices and exercising to burn calories youll be able to systematically and continually shed fat from all area of your body simultaneously. What specific butt training will do is firm, shape and tone the butt muscles that lie beneath that cellulite, preparing for their stunning debut once the fat has been burnt away.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smart also means understanding the importance of being in the game  that is developing the mindset for success. Goal setting, visualisation and self-esteem are all critical elements in achieving a perky posterior.
        </p>

         The female butt is an interesting thing to contemplate. Unlike other parts of the body (with the possible exclusion of the breasts), its an area of fat accumulation that most women are desperate to make bigger rather than smaller. Its also probably the only area of the body where they are happy to get larger muscles. Yes, the derriere is a lesson in contradictions. Lets take a little time to dig beneath the cellulite and find out just what makes your butt tick.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Gluteus Maximus:
         </strong>
         The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle group in your body. It makes up the major part of your butt. The key functions of the glutes are to spread your legs, extend them and turn them. The gluteus maximus works in concert with the gluteus minimus and the gluteus medius to complete these movements as well as to give us a cushion to sit upon.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Gluteus Medius:
         </strong>
         This muscle sort of look like a pork chop is situated near the outside of the pelvis. Its job is to keep your pelvis stable when youre walking or when youre off balance. If we didnt have this stabilizer muscle wed stagger around like an unreformable alcoholic all day long.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Gluteus Minimus:
         </strong>
         This is, as the name implies, the smallest of the three glute muscles. It is situated directly below the gluteus medius. The gluteus minimus assists the gluteus medius to keep you balanced.
        </p>
        <p>
         The three glute muscles play a key role in our overall wellness, strength and conditioning. But only if we keep using them. Unless we spread our legs a lot, extending and turning them through movement and exercise, our glutes will pretty much get a free ride through life. When we sit at a computer, watch TV and even when we walk around, the glutes dont really do anything. Our sedentary lifestyle has meant that we have become non-users of our largest skeletal muscle group. And when we stop using them, our glutes effectively shut down.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effect of glute retirement is that other, smaller and weaker muscles of your body are forced to take up the slack. The key one to take the strain is the erector spinae, the muscles of your lower back. Maybe thats why we have so much lost productivity in our society due to low back strain. Its got more to do with out of shape butt muscles than it has to do with weak back muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other muscle group that picks up the slack is the hamstrings. Hamstring pulls are a common accident / injury cause and, again, its probably got more to do with out of shape glutes than it has with weak hammies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your glutes need to be on the case if you want to have any hope of restoring your bodys vitality, strength and shape. But your glutes need a reason to get into shape. That means targeted exercise. But those glutes of yours arent going to make it easy. It enjoys doing nothing. Unless you do exercises that directly hit your glutes, you will recruit other muscle groups. Thats what happens with walking, running, climbing stairs and the like. While they are good overall leg exercises they are not specifically hitting the glutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The shape of your butt is directly related to the strength of your glutes. Weak, unused, neglected glutes are going to give you a saggy, folded look that gives you a flabby rectangular look. It will lack depth and fullness. A pair of glutes that are in shape, strengthened and well trained, however, will look very different. They will be perky, round and shapely. And what is the ultimate difference between the two?
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Muscle
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, muscle. Muscle gives your butt shape, firmness and beauty. By hitting the glutes consistently from all angles, providing progressive overload and fueling your muscle cells for growth, you will be able to remold your butt and finally find the answer to the question that has been plaguing womankind since time immemorial:

        <h3>
         Activating Your Glutes
        </h3>
        <p>
         A lot of movements that are typically done in the gym are potentially great glute movements. But they are only good if you know how to maximally activate your glutes during the exercises. Exercises like squats, lunges, the plank and push ups all have the potential to get your glutes firing on all cylinders. Most people, however, are not hitting their glutes on these exercises. By learning these exercises over, with an emphasis on glute recruitment, youll be able to totally transform your workout  and your butt.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following bigger butt exercises will allow you to learn how to maximally activate your glutes. This is the first crucial step in learning how to get a bigger butt. Your goal is to feel like your butt is on fire as you do them. At first, you probably wont feel that way. Keep doing these movements every day until you start to zero the focus in on your glutes. Then youll be in a position to benefit from the bigger butt exercises to follow.
        </p>
        <h2>
         The 4 Big Glute Activation Exercises
        </h2>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1) Double Leg Glute Bridge
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         From a supine position with bent legs,
         <a href="http://www.coreperformance.com/knowledge/movements/glute-bridge.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
          push through the heels and raise the hips
         </a>
         into the air. On reaching full hip extension, tense the glutes, spinal erectors and hamstrings. You should feel the greatest muscle activation in the glutes. Be sure not to overarch your lower back. The up/down movement should be limited to the hips. Hold for sixty seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2) Single Leg Glute Bridge  Foam Roller
         </strong>
        </p>
        <div class="videoWrapper">
         <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="329" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9Pwfj5Dghys" width="585">
         </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
         From a supine position, center one bent leg and raise the hips into the air. Keep the non-working leg resting on a foam roller. Without shifting or rotating the core, tense the glutes tightly. Your gluteus maximus should be doing the bulk of the work to lift your lower body into the air. Your lower back should not feel any of the strain. Hold for sixty seconds then repeat with the other leg.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3) Side Lying Clam
         </strong>
        </p>
        <div class="videoWrapper">
         <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="329" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/m7RyKQV4XhE" width="585">
         </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
         From a side lying position, flex the hips about 45 degrees, keeping the heels in contact with one another. The gluteus maximus should contract to rotate externally and lift the leg. Do not twist the spine while holding the extended position for sixty seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4) Bird Dog
         </strong>
        </p>
        <div class="videoWrapper">
         <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="329" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wiFNA3sqjCA" width="585">
         </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
         Start on all fours then lift the left arm up while simultaneously, kicking  the right leg back. Keep the rear leg parallel to the floor. Keep your spine neutral. Hold for sixty seconds then repeat with the other leg.
        </p>
        <p>
         These bigger butt exercises are designed to allow you to isolate and focus your muscular tension on your glutes. If you mainly feel them in your lower back and hamstrings, continue doing them on a daily basis until the focus transfers to your glutes. Over and above glute activation, these movements are great glute workers in themselves. Doing them everyday for a few minutes whenever you get the chance is a great daily habit that will greatly assist you to build a bigger butt.

         The most important aspect in learning how to get a bigger butt has nothing to do with squats, butt blasters or hip thrusts. It doesnt even concern itself with cutting complex carbs from your diet. Clearly these things are important. But, without this other vital factor all of the effort, sacrifice and discipline will be for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most critical factor in acquiring the Brazilian butt of your dreams is simply to make up your mind to do it. That may sound simple and it may even sound obvious. However, the reason that the vast majority of people fail to achieve their physical goals, whether they revolve around their butt or any other part of their body, is that they dont have the mental strength to follow through.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its an interesting fact that nearly all of those body transformation blow-outs are the same people who will skip the mindset section of their workout guide. Perhaps feeling that they dont need any touchy feely positive thinking, they skip past this section in order to get to the meaty stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          That is a mistake.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Unless you are able to develop the mindset that will allow you to follow through on your exercise and nutrition program with consistency, desire and passion every day, you will fail to reach your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, unless you learn how to properly set goals, you will never achieve anything you set your mind to. The leanest people in the world know the secrets of the psychology of fitness. So do the women with the greatest butts on the planet. Its about time you joined them.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Get Selfish
        </h3>
        <p>
         A major reason that women around the world fail is their selfless nature. They spend so much time catering to the needs of everyone else  their children, their partner, their boss, their parents  that they simply dont have the time or the energy to give to themselves. Clearly this is counterproductive. After all, unless you look after your own health and well-being, you are inevitably going to run out of puff  and then youll be no good to anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
         In effect then, by taking time every day to look after your own health, well-being and happiness, you are looking after everyone else in your network. So, be a little selfish and prioritize the time to prioritize your butt.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Get Positive
        </h3>
        <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_62958" style="width: 595px">

         If youre like most people, you will have approximately 60,000 thoughts cross through your mind every day. And of those myriad thoughts, the vast majority (98%) are likely to be negative:
        </p>
        <p>
         I hate exercising.
         <em>
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         I cant resist that cream puff.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ill never get a butt like that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The conversation that you have going on in your head all day long is critical to your actions. The fact that, for most of us, that self talk is predominantly negative has a profound impact on what we are able (and unable) to achieve. But what if you could take conscious control over those thoughts. What if you could banish the negativity from your mind and create an environment built on positivity. Well, guess what:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          YOU CAN!
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         After all, the one thing that you possess that no one can take away from you are your thoughts. You are in control of them  no one else. Sometimes, of course, you cannot control the thoughts that enter your mind. But you CAN control what you do about them.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you detect a negative thought creeping into your fertile garden of positive thoughts, you need to view it as a weed and pull it out immediately. At first, you may find yourself pulling weeds left, right and center. Before long, however, you will be developing a mental environment of positivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         By not allowing yourself to succumb to stinkin thinkin, youll be creating a foundation for success that will propel you towards your butt changing goals. This will, in turn, allow you to tap into the most powerful force for change known to man  the human subconscious.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Tap Into the Subconscious
        </h3>

         Your mind is like an iceberg. The part that is visible above the water is like your conscious mind. Thats the part that you use during your waking hours to think, reason, take information in through the senses and rationalize your experiences. The massive unseen part of the iceberg is like your subconscious mind. Thats the part that neither thinks nor reasons. It does not operate on the basis of logic at all. What it does do is to store your automatic reflex behaviours, your memory and regulates all of your automatic bodily functions. The subconscious does not have the ability to sift or sort information. It simply accepts it as fat and acts upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The subconscious acts in the same way as the cyborg in the
         <em>
          Terminator
         </em>
         movies. If it is programmed, it will carry out that programming with unrelenting determination. It will not stop until that programmed thought is accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, what messages get carried from the conscious to the subconscious as commands? They are the messages that are repeated over and over again with emotion and energy. You can imagine, then, that all of those people who are constantly telling themselves that they cant do something are setting themselves up for failure. They are, in effect, programming their subconscious for failure. Even if they were to begin an exercise program  even if they learnt how to get a bigger butt  their subconscious would find a way to sabotage their efforts and cause them to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Only by succeeding with Step No. 2 will you be able to program your subconscious for success. Having rooted out the negativity from your mind, you are in a powerful position to repeat positive goal directed thoughts to yourself. By making such statements as if they have already been accomplished, you will be making a powerful impression on your subconscious. Heres an example:
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Im walking along the beach in a g-string. My butt is firm, round and luscious. I love it.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Repeat this often enough to yourself and your subconscious will take over and do the rest. It will, in effect, transform you into a cyborg, zoning in on your physical goals are surely as Arnold Schwarzenegger was bound to find Sarah Connor.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Set Goals  the Right Way
        </h3>
        <p>
         Imagine playing a game of basketball blindfolded. You know theres a goal somewhere, but you cant see it. Its not clearly defined. Your chances of getting the ball through that goal are going to be very slim.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its the same thing in life. Without a clearly defined goal your chances of achieving your ambitions are going to be minimal. With a clear goal, however, you will be able to achieve unbelievable things.
        </p>
        <p>
         Goals originate in the conscious mind, but they direct the subconscious mind, which is the real key to success. It is the subconscious that directs your automatic or habitual actions. Goal setting will allow you to train your subconscious in order for healthy eating, intense training and positive lifestyle habits to be your bodys default settings.
        </p>
        <h3>
         The most powerful goal-setting system in the world involves 5 distinct steps as follows:
        </h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1. Make your goals specific:
         </strong>
         Rather than saying that you want to lose weight, tell yourself specifically how much you want to lose. What body fat percentage do you want to reach? What do you want your biceps to measure? Make your goal as specific as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2. Make your goals measurable:
         </strong>
         Unless you can measure your progress, you wont be able to monitor your progress toward your goal. When it comes to losing body fat, youll want to use a pair of scales with the ability to show your body composition. This will tell you, not just how much weight youve lost, but, more importantly, how much fat youve lost.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3. Make your goals worthwhile:
         </strong>
         Rather than being limited by what you think you can achieve, set the big goals that you really want to achieve. A big goal will motivate you, stir you to action and allow you to be the best you that you possibly can be. In terms of your physique goals, find a photo of the type of body you would ideally want to have and set your goals around it.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4. Make your deadline realistic:
         </strong>
         All of those infomercial ads that promise rapid weight loss fail to distinguish between fat, muscle and water loss. The truth is that you cannot lose more than 1-2 pounds of fat per week. Keep this in mind when establishing the timeline for your goals. So set big goals but make sure that you establish realistic deadlines as to their fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          5. Make stepping stone mini-goals:
         </strong>
         Small, realistic goals that build upon each other on your way to your ultimate goal will allow your big goal to be broken down into monthly, weekly and daily mini-goals. This will allow you keep a deadline before you every day. Your daily goals should revolve around your meals and your exercise sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In summary, then, you need to commit your goals to writing, make them specific, measurable, worthwhile, realistic, tied to an achievable deadline and graduated from daily right through to yearly goals, with each succeeding goal building upon the last. Then you should take a medium term goal (maybe one that youve set to achieve in 3 months) and write it on a business-sized card that you carry with your every day. Read it up to 7 times each day to keep you focused and to feed your sub-conscious into automatic follow-through.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dont underestimate this, its one of the most important aspects of getting a bigger butt  if you dont motivate yourself, nobody else will! Tap into your subconscious mind, its way more powerful than you can imagine!

         Marketing moguls have turned food into a frustratingly complicated subject. It was never meant to be. After all, our forefathers knew how to put decent food in front of their families without any intricate understanding of antioxidants or amino acids. They were able to get all of the fuel that they needed AND they didnt pack on the pounds in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, we put in front of our families things that our forefathers wouldnt even recognize as food. We have stood by as food manufacturers and processors have removed the goodness from our foods. The more human hands tamper with and meddle in the natural processes of food production, the more toxic those foods become. The trade off to making these foods tastier and longer lasting is that they have become packed with chemicals that our body neither wants nor needs.

         Processed foods are not the only things robbing you of a bootylicious butt. Sugar is as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unless you manage to get a handle on your sugar intake, you will never learn how to get a bigger butt.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sugar is the silent saboteur that has crept into our diet while we were all transfixed on eliminating fat. Back in the 1990s, fat was identified as the demon that was making us all obese. Food marketers responded by labeling everything as Lite, Reduced Fat and Fat Free. The problem was that fat was the thing that was giving the foods their flavor. Without it, those Lite foods tasted like cardboard. They had to add something to bring back the flavour, and that something happened to be
        </p>
        <p>
         Now sugar just happens to be addictive. In fact, it has been shown to trigger the same reward centers in our brains as cocaine does. When we get addicted to something, we take more of it. But that leads to a lowering of our tolerance, meaning that to satisfy our craving we need to take in even more of the substance. When that happens with sugar, we get fat.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the biggest sources of sugar is sodas. You know that they are bad for you. We all do. Yet, there is something about them that appears to have an irresistible hold on us. The average American drinks 597 cans of soda pop each year  thats more than 1  cans every day. To put the impact of that into perspective, 597 cans of soda will pour 32 pounds of sugar down your throat. And did you know that drinking liquid sugar will make you gain fat faster than simply eating the sugar?
        </p>
        <p>
         This challenge may not be easy, especially if you are an average soda consumer. The caffeine in your soda has an addictive component to it. Cutting off your soda intake may cause headaches. This is a reaction to all of the toxins that have built up as a result of your soda habit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits of going cold turkey on soda and fruit juices (theyre also packed with sugar) are immediate. You will feel more alert, vibrant and light.

         Your body contains between 50 and 70% water depending on your age and how much muscle and fat you have on your frame. Muscle tissue contains more water than fat does. Without water, you will die in a matter of days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why is water so vital to your survival? Well, water is a solvent. It dissolves other substances and carries nutrients and other material around the body, making it possible for every organ to do its job. Water is needed to carry waste products out of the body, to digest food, to lubricate your moving parts, to provide a medium in which biochemical reactions take place, to regulate body temperature and to send electrical messages between cells to enable us to do everything that we do.
        </p>
        <p>
         As much as 75% of the water in your body is contained within your cells. The rest is contained in blood plasma, bodily secretions, the fluid between cells, lymph and urine. A body that is in a state of fluid balance will have just the right amount of fluid inside and outside the cells. If there is too little water inside your cells, they will shrivel and die. If there is too much water inside the cell, the muscle will burst. To establish and maintain that essential fluid balance, your body has things called electrolytes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Electrolytes are mineral compounds that, when dissolved in water, become electrically charged particles called ions. Sodium, potassium and chlorine are the principal electrolytes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under normal circumstances, the fluid inside your cells has more potassium than sodium and chloride. The fluid outside is just the opposite  it has more sodium and potassium than chloride. The cell wall is a semi-permeable membrane. This means that some things are able to pass through but others are not. Water molecules and small mineral molecules flow through freely, unlike larger molecules such as proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
         The process by which sodium flows out and potassium flows in to keep things on an even keel is called the sodium pump. If this process were to stop, sodium ions would build up inside your cells. Sodium attracts water, so the more sodium there is inside a cell, the more water flows in. Eventually, without the sodium pump effect, the cell would burst and die. The sodium pump, regular as a clock, prevents this imbalance from happening.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you dont get enough water, youre body will let you know pretty quickly. The first sign is thirst. The second sign is reduced urination. If you dont pay attention to these signals, your tissues begin to dry out. Make water a lifelong commitment and your body will repay the effort many times over.
        </p>

         Muscle Nutrition
        </h3>
        <p>
         A firm, round, bootylicious butt is a muscular butt. Developing that muscle means taking in extra protein. Protein is the basis of who you are. After water, it is the most abundant thing in your body. Protein is what builds muscle. To get a bigger butt you have to take in protein, especially immediately after youve been working your butt off, in order to reconstruct it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Protein is found in red meat, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, tofu and, to a lesser extent, in plants. To build muscle, its a good idea to supplement with a protein shake, especially immediately after your workout. Just ensure that the protein from whole foods makes up at least 70% of your total daily protein intake. Look for a micronized whey protein powder as this form of protein transports the protein into your bloodstream and to the muscle cells quicker than any other.
        </p>
        <p>
         To calculate your daily protein requirement, take 1 gram for every pound of body weight.

         Brazilian Butts are epitomized by their perkiness, their roundness, their firmness and their shapeliness. Well, those beautiful bigger butts dont just come about by symbiosis. No, they take a whole lot of hard work. But what sort of hard work?
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Weight training.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, weight training. Thats what all of those Brazilian beauties are doing. Not just a set or two of squats thrown in as part of a general all-over resistance routine. No  they hit the iron hard and they hit it hard specifically focusing on their glutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weights and women are a pretty hard sell. Thats because most ladies have a subconscious fear of becoming bulky and unfeminine. Well, the good news is that that is extremely unlikely to happen  even if you want it to. Weights are a tool that you use to produce the sort of body that
         <strong>
          you
         </strong>
         desire. And, if the sort of booty you desire is one that turns heads (for the right reasons) then using weights will get you there. To do it, though, youll have to build and shape your muscles. That will take hard work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Women only have about 10% of the levels of testosterone that men do. Testosterone is what builds muscle. You are severely limited in the amount of muscle that you can build. Unless you resort to steroids (we dont recommend it), your weight training sessions will not turn you into a body behemoth. What it will do is to allow you to shape a sexy, lean, fat free body that sports a butt beyond belief.

         Weights vs. Cardio

         Ever since Dr. Kenneth Cooper coined the term aerobics back in the early 1970s, a debate has been raging between resistance training and cardio. From the very start of the gym explosion, a gender divide has existed in training centers based on these two exercise types. You still see it today. Walk into any gym in North America, Europe or Oceania and youll see the divide clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The women can be found inhabiting the cardio room. Theyll be jogging, walking, rowing and stepping away the hours with a light resistance and relatively low intensity. The men, of course, hang out in the weights area. Theyll be pumping away under the heavy iron. Women, cardio. Men, weights. Thats just the way it is.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unless youre in a gym in Brazil that is.
        </p>
        <p>
         Down there women have come to understand that cardio doesnt build shape. Working with weights does. Thats because it will get you stronger. And a stronger muscle is a firmer, more shapely muscle. So, if you want to attain to a bigger butt, youll need to get stronger glutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, does that mean that cardio has no place in your bigger butt workout routine? Not quite. Apart from building and shaping your butt, you are probably going to want to remove some fat tissue from it. And, while its true that you cannot spot reduce fat from your butt, the right type of cardio exercise will allow you to burn calories from all parts of your body. That will be essential to achieving your Brazilian butt look. Because most cardio exercise involves working your legs, high intensity cardio will also allow you to shape your glutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our Brazilian butt workout routine will involve a mixture of cardiovascular exercise and resistance training. The cardio that youll do will be fast and furious. It will also be the most effective type of fat burning cardio known to man. When combined with the targeted weight training program that were about to show you, it will allow you strip off the fat and reveal the beautiful Brazilian butt that youve been craving for so long.

         If there is a secret to realising a kick butt derriere, then weight training is it. Weight training will put you in control of your body. It will allow you to lose fat while retaining, shaping and building your lean body mass. Here are four reasons why weight training will get you to your bigger, more luscious butt goal quicker than any other method:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Weight training burns calories like crazy.
         </li>
         <li>
          Weight training will allow you to reshape the muscles of your butt (the glutes)
         </li>
         <li>
          Weight training will makes you stronger  and a strong butt is a firm, sexy butt
         </li>
         <li>
          Weight training will increase your flexibility around the core and hips
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Before you get under the heavy iron, its critical that you get up to speed with some fundamental weight training truths. Here are three principles that you need to get familiar with in order to make the most of your butt blasting resistance training regimen:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Progressive Overload:
         </strong>
         Basically, this equates to performing a personal best on every workout. Unless you are continually do a little more each time, your body will adapt and refuse to respond. Progressive overload may involve increasing the resistance slightly, it may mean doing an extra one or two repetitions or reducing the rest between sets. Whatever form it takes, you constantly need to be striving to be better than the previous time.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Training Intensity:
         </strong>
         When performing an exercise, you dont want it to be too easy  or too hard. Youll know youve got it right if the last 2 or 3 reps on your set are difficult to perform. Youll feel a tightness in the working muscle as the blood rushes to that area. Thats when you have to push it. Its those last two or three difficult reps that will reap the most reward.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Tempo:
         </strong>
         This is about the speed with which you perform your repetitions. There are two parts to any exercise  the lifting (concentric) phase and the lowering (eccentric) phase. Studies have confirmed that eccentric training is as effective at building and shaping your muscles as concentric training. An effective training tempo involves two seconds to perform the concentric part of the movement and four seconds on the eccentric phase. By resisting gravity through the eccentric portion, you will give your muscles a greater work load  thats a good thing.

         There are three types of grips used to grab a dumbbell, barbell or weight machine handle: Pronated (overhand), supinated (underhand) and mixed (one hand each way). With an overhand grip your knuckles face up and your thumbs are toward each other. For an underhand grip, your palms face up and point away from each other. All three grips should be closed grips. This is when the fingers and thumbs are wrapped around the bar. The opposite to this is an open grip, where the thumbs do not wrap around the bar. You should avoid using an open grip because the bar may roll out of your grip, especially when you are using a heavy weight. Grip width varies with the specific exercise that you are performing. A shoulder width grip is standard for most movements, however.
        </p>

         <strong>
          Lifting the Bar:
         </strong>
         It is vital that you learn the proper technique to lift a bar from the floor. Here are the steps that you need to adhere to:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Stand in front of the bar, feet flat on the floor and shoulder width apart. Your toes should be pointing slightly outward.
         <br/>
         2. Tightening your core (pull in your stomach and pull back your upper back), squat down in front of the bar.
         <br/>
         3. Grasp the bar with a closed, over-hand shoulder width grip.
         <br/>
         4. Look up, ensuring that your back is in a flat, rather than a rounded position. Your shoulder should be back and your chest out.
         <br/>
         5. Keep the bar close to your body, rise to a standing position. The power for the lift should come from your thighs, rather than your back.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Breathing:
         </strong>
         Never hold your breath when working with weights. In fact, you should just breathe naturally. As you progress through the sticking point of each exercise, you should exhale. As the weight moves back to the start position in readiness for the next rep, you should inhale.

          Safety Considerations
         </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Loading a Barbell:
         </strong>
         Its amazing how many people seem to forget about gravity when changing the weight in a barbell. The bar can be sitting on the bench press rack and along comes some noob intent on changing the weight. They take the collar off one end and then slip the weight off, oblivious to the fact that gravity is about to cause that, now lighter, end of the bar to fly up into their face. That sort of carelessness could cause someone to lose an eye. Lesson: Have another person pull of the weight at the other end while you are changing it. Always load a bar evenly.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Lock Barbells:
         </strong>
         Always make sure that the collars are tightly affixed to the ends of the bar before performing a set. Check them again between sets as they can easily come loose during the set.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Use a Spotter When Going Heavy:
         </strong>
         If you dont have a training partner to provide a spot for you, ask a gym instructor to help you. The spotter should be positioned in front of you, ready to give you balanced assistance with their finger tips when you reach the sticking point.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Dont use Momentum:
         </strong>
         You want the working muscle to do the work, not gravity or momentum. By lowering the weight to a count of four, pausing momentarily and then focusing on using the target muscle to lift, you will be working the muscle only. When you are using a machine with a weight stack attached, dont allow the weight plates to slam down on the rest of the stack between reps.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Keep Your Core Tight and Back Straight:
         </strong>
         This will avoid the tendency to swing you back into the movement, avoid lower back strain and give your abs an auxiliary workout on every exercise.

         How to Get a Bigger Butt  atHome

         <img alt="athletic woman doing exercise" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62721" height="390" src="http://youqueen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/athletic-woman-doing-exercise.jpg" width="585"/>

        <p>
         Exercise professionals (that is, people who make money from your desire to have a bigger butt) would love to convince you that you need to join a gym to attain to your physical goals. Well, its time to kick that myth in the butt for good.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gyms can be convenient. They can also be motivating. But they can also be a major hassle to get to with valuable downtime in transit and lots of waiting around for equipment. Then again, a lot women just cant afford the luxury of getting away from the home every other day.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can get an extremely effective bigger butt workout at home. But to do so, youll have to invest in some basic equipment. Heres what youll need:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          An exercise mat
         </li>
         <li>
          A Swiss ball
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The key to effectiveness in this and any other program is to pay attention to how your muscles feel during the exercises that you are performing. You need to feel the target muscle working intensely. You constantly need to be focused, also on doing the movement correctly, from the first rep to the last.
        </p>
        <p>
         This Home Butt Building Workout relies predominantly on body weight resistance. In other words, you are using your own body as the weight. Your body is your first and, in many ways, your most effective workout tool.

          Notes
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Perform the above bigger butt workout for 6 weeks and you will totally transform your rear end. The recommended sets and reps should be worked up to. Start with just one set for the first week, then progress to two sets the second week and three in week three. During weeks four, five and six continue adding sets and reps (along with time on the plank) in accordance with the progressive overload principle.

          Gorgeous Gym Glutes
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         While your body is able to provide you with everything you require for a butt blasting workout, taking your butt to the gym affords you both more exercise options and the capacity for increased resistance. The following 2 workout options provide you with plenty of both. They are totally focused on working your glutes, which youll recall is the biggest muscle group in your body. That means that while working your butt youll also be burning spare calories.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should perform your Butt Blasting gym sessions twice a week, with two to three days between sessions. Do Workout A the first day and Workout B the second day. On your off days, it will be time to do the cardio training that will be outlined in the next section.

         Your resistance training workouts are going to sculpt and build a beautiful butt. But, unless that beautiful but can be seen, all of your hard work will be in vain. Your cardio sessions are designed to siphon away the fat that is covering your rear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whats the most effective form of cardio to burn calories? That question has been debated for decades. A slew of recent studies, however, have made it pretty clear that short, intense cardio sessions (think sprinting on a track) have a number of benefits over long, slow cardio (think walking on a treadmill). Not only do they burn more calories while youre doing the exercise but hey also give your metabolism a boost so that your body becomes a fat burning furnace for the next 24 hours  even while youre watching TV.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hard fast cardio or HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) will also get you fitter faster. An added bonus is that it will dramatically reduce your training time. In fact, youll only be working out for six minutes per session on this program.
        </p>
        <h3>
         HIIT Butt
        </h3>
        <p>
         Follow these easy steps to get the most effective workout to kick butt on the planet:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Choose an exercise that will enable you to work at maximum speed for short duration sprints (sprinting on the track, cycling and using a rowing machine a great options).
         </li>
         <li>
          Make sure that you can see a timer with a second hand or have a partner call out times to you
         </li>
         <li>
          Do a slow 2 minutes warm up.
         </li>
         <li>
          Perform an all-out sprint for exactly 20 seconds  you need to push to the absolute limit (if running, imagine that youre being chased by a Doberman!).
         </li>
         <li>
          Recover for 10 seconds.
         </li>
         <li>
          Repeat the process for a total of 8 rounds.
         </li>
         <li>
          Collapse!
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         They key to the effectiveness of this workout is to maintain the intensity of your sprint. Obviously you will slow down slightly during the last two or three sprints, but you must keep digging deep to minimize that drop off.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is hard work. But its also short work. In all of 6 minutes you will have completed an awesome cardio workout, allowing you top get on with the rest of your day.
        </p>
        <p>
         The above workout is to be performed on three alternate days throughout the week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Good luck!
        </p>

         Congratulations. Youve now got the head knowledge to allow you to create your own perfect Brazilian butt. But head knowledge is never enough. If youre like 78% of readers of fitness books, youll take this knowledge and
        </p>
        <p>
         Do Nothing With It!
        </p>
        <p>
         Dont be like them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Use the tools at your disposal to claim the body that you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
         The road to lifelong fitness is a challenging one. Other things crowd in, we get busy and just becomes easier to creep back to those old habits  you know, the ones that created that before butt that you so desperately wanted to get rid off. The following tips will help you to stay on track.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1)Get Your Family Involved
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Incorporating fitness into your family lifestyle is one of the greatest gifts you can give to them. So, get the family off the couch and out in the fresh air. Go bike riding together, take a hike  have a picnic. Rather than allowing your kids to spend endless hours playing computer games, go and buy them a soccer ball!
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2) Dont Take it Personally
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Sometimes youll encounter people who are dismissive  maybe even critical  of your efforts to sculpt a bigger butt and improve your overall fitness. Dont sweat it. Their criticism is more often than not more about their own insecurities than anything that you happen to be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3)Focus on Today
         </strong>
        </p>
        <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_62955" style="width: 595px">

         Looking toward your big goals can seem daunting, even unreachable. Your Brazilian butt workout wont achieve a kick-ass butt in a week or even two. To stay motivated and keep on track, you need to focus on whats immediately in front of you. Set your goals around what is immediately in front of you  your workout, your daily nutrition and your cardio sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4)Get Back on the Horse
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         It is inevitable that youll slip up sometimes. It may be a busy workday when youre rushing all over town and just cant resist the convenience of a McDonalds Drive Thru. Or perhaps you miss a couple of workouts. Dont try to make them up. Just refocus on the day ahead and make sure that you do what you have to do with whats in front of you.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          5)Treat Yourself (Occasionally)
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Set a monthly goal and, when you reach it, give yourself a treat. Your goal might revolve around your workouts, your body fat levels or your nutritional plan. Whatever you choose, keep in mind that your reward doesnt have to revolve around food. Buy yourself a CD or a book for a calories free way to keep yourself motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Your completion of this program will set you up for a lifetime of fitness. It will have you sporting a killer butt and to die for legs and core to go with it. Youll also be stronger than you ever thought possible. But the most important benefits will happen between your ears. Youll have tons more energy, your mood will be greatly improved and your self-esteem will sky rocket. In short, you will both look and feel great. Now that you know how to get a bigger butt, all thats left is that you make the first step!
