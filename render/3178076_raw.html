             Good to be here Frank. Although I cant stay long. Were rehearsing for the final tour.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rehearsing? What the fuck? Youve been rehearsing for the past 50 years.

             Its the new guys idea, Trey. We probably should have gone with John K.

             Amen to that. So what brings you back? Ive missed you. Things just havent been the same in here without having you as one of the imaginary voices in my head.

             Just wanted to swing by and say I was sorry to hear about Monty. She was the greatest dog in the world.

            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you, Frank, for having me. Are you coming to the event in Hartford this weekend?
            </p>
            <p>
             Sadly, no. Im driving over to Tampa to catch some Yankees Spring Training. Figure itll be my only chance all season to spit on ARod.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, have fun. You know how I feel about going to baseball games.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, I wanted to ask you about your quote in the Hartford Courant yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             What about it? I thought it was a very apt comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe. But only if you happened to have attended a lot of really,

             Danke, Herr Towers. My condolences. How are you doing? Can I ask you about your mother? How is your relationship with her?
            </p>
            <p>
             Really?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, that was a joke. I was just trying to cheer you up. You look kinda depressed. Have you ever considered seeing a psychiatrist?
            </p>
            <p>
             I did.
            </p>
            <p>
             And?
            </p>
            <p>
             I told him the death of Monty made me very depressed. Especially coming so soon after the death of Rommel.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you tell him that those were the names of the two beagles with whom you shared your life for almost 20 years?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. I told him my name was General Dwight D. Eisenhower 
            </p>
            <p>
             Why?
            </p>
            <p>
             I figured hed give me better drugs.

            <p>
             Mr. Towers, sir. First off, I want to thank you for giving me asylum here in your brain. This is quite a crew you got in here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever. Get to the point. Im still pissed at you for using my credit card to send all those flowers to North Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know. I deeply regret both maxing out your credit card, and jeopardizing our location. I can assure you, however, they wont get any information out of the florist. North Korean Florists are tough. Not like your American Florists.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you know about American Florists, Kim Jung-Un?
            </p>
            <p>
             We captured one once. We were able to get him to admit he was spying for the CIA, the location of every landmine in the DMZ and the location of every tactical nuclear weapon launch facility in South Korea simply by threatening to deny him access to the BRAVO network for a year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever. You said you had something to show me. What is it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, as we both know, the blood moon did not convince your subjects that the end of the world is nigh and that they must pledge their allegiance to you or die. However, this time I have arranged a far more powerful warning that Coconut Grove will soon be ravaged by death, disease and pestilence. Look sir, out your window; and behold, for I, Kim Jung-Un, the former Supreme Being and Lord of North Korea - I give you this.
            </p>
            <p>
             What? I dont see anything?
            </p>
            <p>
             Wait for it, wait for it
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit, is that a
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, it is. A kettle of Vultures. Slowly circling down from the heavens.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit. Thats awesome. Vultures. Huzzah.
            </p>
            <p>
             Youre welcome, Mr. Towers. Let us celebrate the arrival of this ominous portend of death with the sharing of cheese.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not so fast, Kum Jun-Un. And no more cheese for you.
            </p>
            <p>
             I dont understand.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here in Miami, Vultures arent a symbol of disease and pestilence. Quite the opposite. Like the Swallows of Capistrano, their arrival is cause for great celebration. The arrival of the Vultures means the rainy season is about to end. Summer is almost over. And this year, t

            <p>
             Im sorry, Frank. It wont happen again.

             It fucking better not. Not only was it a serious breach of security, but he maxed out my credit card.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ill pay you back. How many yaks, goats and assorted other livestock do I owe you?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well talk about that later. But its not the money so much as it is the breach of security. Theyre probably gonna torture the guy from FTD who delivered the arrangement, and I doubt it will take long for him to give up my name and address."

             Frank, I dont know what to say.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, I think I speak for all of we imaginary voices in your head when I say that 3:53 AM is way too early for these Morning Intelligence Briefings. Any chance we can have these at a more normal hour, like, say, 6:00 AM?
            </p>
            <p>
             Herr Freud, would you like to explain to Ludwig Van Beethoven why the Morning Intelligence Briefings now occur at this hour?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes. Everybody, Herr Towers is suffering from insomnia. He is no longer capable of sleeping past 3:30 AM.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there anything we can do make it stop? Because getting up at this hour sucks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, but unfortunately Herr Towers refuses to heed my advice and seek medical attention for his condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hang on a second, Dr. Freud, youre telling us the reason we are all up at this hour is because Frank wont go see a doctor and get a scrip for a barbiturate? Frank, Frank Towers, the same guy who once ate so many Ambien he forgot where he parked his car and reported it stolen to the DC Police? Only to have the DC Police find it a week later, parked in front of a strip club, with the keys in the ignition?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now hold on a second, Bob Weir. You tell that story like it was a bad thing. Yes, back when I was living in DC, I did have eat an Ambien or two while having a few beers, then drove to strip club, only to wake up the next morning to find my car was missing from the driveway. But that story is more about the good sense I showed by taking a cab home. The fact that I had no recollection of ever leaving the house in the first place and therefore assumed my car had been stolen while I slept is just a humorous footnote to that anecdote.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, Herr Weir. Franks insomnia is a symptom of a far more serious condition. While I cant divulge the specifics due to our patient-doctor confidentiality agreement, I can say that Franks insomnia, along with his severe ennui, paranoiaand withdrawal from any type of social interaction, are all signs he his suffering from a crippling case of clinical depression."
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks, Dr. Freud. Way to honor our confidentiality agreement. You forgot the part about my erectile dysfunction and the hemorrhoid I got growing on my ass thats roughly the size of Abe Vigodas head.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im sorry, Herr Towers. But, as we are all imaginary voices in your head, I felt it my duty to alert the others as to the condition of their living quarters.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hi everybody. Sorry were late. What did we miss?
            </p>
            <p>
             Princesses, so glad you could make it. How was South Beach? See any celebrities? Did Shia LaBeouf punch anybody?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, but we did meet some Hollywood types. And Frank, youre not going to believe what they told us.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lemme guess - they told you theyre here in town scouting for talent to star in a major motion picture? Then invited you up to their room to do cocaine?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. Theyre here in town celebrating the release of a documentary they made. Frank, its a documentary about Ebola. And ISIS. And how the terrorists are going to use Ebola as a weapon. Everything youve been saying since March 27th. And get this, according their documentary, ISIS is planning to use Ebola to attack Bob Weir.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wait, what? ISIS is going to use Ebola to attack me?

             For what?

            <p>
             Kim Jung-Un gave me the idea. As he was leaving, he told me that the secret to managing your subjects in a cult of personality is to take credit for celestial events. Its a trick he learned from the Aztecs.

            <p>
             Your plan sucks, Frank. Im going back to bed. This is the dumbest thing youve done since Ive been here. Nobody is going to believe the blood moon has anything to do with the pending zombie apocalypse. Its fucking 2014. If you want to strike fear in peoples hearts, use the internet. Thats what ISIS is doing. And thats why ISIS is kicking Ebolas ass as far as the news media is concerned. If you want to convince people that the Ebola crisis is the start of the long dread zombie apocalypse, use the fucking internet, not a fucking hacked road sign. Social media is where it's at."

             Ladies, Gentlemen. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I am sorry to inform you, but today will be our final Morning Intelligence Briefing. I am canceling the Omega Man Protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
             What?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, its true. You are all free to leave now. You may pick up your paychecks as you exit my brain. I want to thank you all for coming, and for your sage and most excellent advice during the crisis, but your services are no longer required. Be excellent to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, why? Why are you canceling the Omega Man Protocol? Is this about the defector?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. Nor is it about Kim Jung-Un eating all the Swiss Cheese. I sent Kim home yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             You sent Kim home? But, he was family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im sorry, Genghis Khan, I know you two were tight. But I was afraid harboring a dying despot as an imaginary voice here in my brain could lead to more than just defections.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like what?
            </p>
            <p>
             I didnt want his being here to put our overseas embassies at risk. Just as harboring the Shah of Iran did back in 1979.
            </p>
            <p>
             But
            </p>
            <p>
             Dont worry. I spent all day yesterday working on a press release which will explain his absence to The North Korean people.

            <p>
             I know, Billy the Kid, but the bottom line is - Ebola is old news. Even Fox has stopped covering it. Theyre not even blaming it on Obamacare any more. The NYSE has recovered, the panic in Dallas never happened, and were still years away from some major pharmaceutical company rushing a cure to market which will backfire and turn people into zombies.

            <p>
             Oh hey Frank. Whats up?
            </p>
            <p>
             Have you met the new guy yet? Friend of Genghis Khan?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "No. Why?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Just curious. I haven't met him either, only saw him once, in the kitchen. Short, walks with a limp. Genghis Khan says he's only crashing here for a little while until he gets some shit worked out back home. Dr. Sigmund Freud screened him, say's he's not infected. Although hisTriglycerides are through the roof. If you see him, let him know I'd like to meet him."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Will do. Speaking of new guys, when is Rufus gonna get here?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "I don't know, why?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Me and Ludwig Van Beethoven wanna jam with him."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Cool. I'm sure he'd enjoy that as well. How are you and Ludwig Van Beethoven getting along?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Me and Ludwig Von Beethoven have been making most triumphant music together every since he got here. In fact, once Rufus arrives, and assuming we can teach the Princesses to play drums and percussion, and Joan of Arc to play bass, were thinking about maybe touring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Touring? Bob, thats great news. You on rhythm, Rufus on lead, Joan of Arc on bass, duel drummers who also happen to be most excellent babes, and Ludwig Van Beethoven on keyboards. You could tour the most ravaged parts of West Africa, providing a welcome respite to weary aid workers as they struggle to keep the ebola virus contained far from our shores. Kinda like the USO.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, we were thinking more along the lines of a few gigs in Cali, maybe a quick run in Port Chester
            </p>
            <p>
             Pish posh, Bob. West Africa it is. You could even hand out packets of DripDrop to infected patients, thus bolstering its claim to be a medical grade rehydration formula. This is brilliant Bob. I cant believe I didnt think of this before. Imagine the photo ops. You, busting out in song, unafraid and undaunted by thousands of ebola patients crowding the stage for one last taste of happiness before they pass, weeping tears of blood from their eyes as they lay dying at your feet. Have you come up with a name for the new band?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, not yet, and like I said, if we do tour, itll be something small. Maybe even keep it right here in Miami. A couple of Friday nights at the Sailing Club, at most.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brilliant. A series of small, unannounced gigs which we will use to publicize your upcoming tour of Liberia. Sponsored by DripDrop. Done and done. Now, about the name for your new band. Lets seehow about
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, were a long way from needing a name. In fact, Im thinking maybe this whole touring thing might be a bad idea
            </p>
            <p>
             How about Camper Van Bob Weir? Thats catchy. Although maybe too obscure. 'The Grateful Dying'?  'The Not Dead, Yet?'"
            </p>
            <p>
             "These are all great suggestions, Frank. But like I said, I think we're getting way to far ahead of ourselves here...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Lemme work on it for you Bob. Itd be a real honor to name your new band.
            </p>
            <p>
             You do that, Frank. Meanwhile, Ill go see what I can learn about this new guy. You say he's short, walks with a limp?"
            </p>

             thank you, Mr. The Kid, for your most excellent report. Let the record show, that upon the advice of Billy The Kid, henceforth it shall be Standard Operating Procedure to always shoot zombies twice. Double tap. Whos next? Mr. Lincoln?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you, Mr. Towers. Ive been looking at the poll numbers, and your approval ratings took a plunge yesterday. Apparently the voting public didnt take kindly to your bragging about shooting homeless people with a bb gun. Should you wish to be perceived as a kindly and wise ruler of this pending post apocalyptic world, I suggest henceforth you should conduct those drills in secrecy. The way Nixon bombed Cambodia during the Viet Nam War, for example. Socrates agrees with me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you, Mr. Lincoln. Yes, Frank. Its true. You need to work on your image. Its ok to be violent, when threatened, but you must also exude the perception that you are a compassionate man. Remember, both Charlton Heston Robert Neville and Will Smith Robert Neville were doctors, and both went out of their way to find a cure for the epidemic. Often putting their own personal safety at risk while doing so, I might add.
            </p>
            <p>
             Way ahead of you Socrates. Dr. Freud, where are we on finding the cure?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you, Herr Towers. Currently, at least a half dozen drugs are in various stages of development and testing. Three of them, ZMapp, TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537, are considered farthest along. The good news is the most promising of these, ZMapp, is tobacco based. Which suggests you may already be immune to Ebola, given your two-pack a day habit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whats the bad news?
            </p>
            <p>
             The bad news is, we all know it will be the cure for ebola which will ultimately be responsible for turning the dead and dying into the undead and undying. Whether these zombies are the slow moving kind, as in Max Brook's novel, World War Z; or the fast moving kind that overran the walls of Jerusalem in the film adaptation of the book, starring Brad Pitt, will ultimately depend on

             When was the last time you slept?
            </p>
            <p>
             Cant talk now, Bob. Kinda busy
            </p>
            <p>
             I can see that. Is this about the Ebola Virus? Frank?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Bob, this is about the Ebola Virus. I am initiating The Omega Man Protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is that why you drove around Miami yesterday shooting at homeless people with a bb gun?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Bob. After years of study, I have determined that homeless people are the answer.
            </p>
            <p>
             To what question?
            </p>
            <p>
             The answer to the question, what target can I practice on which most behaves like zombies. Homeless people, obviously. The way they trod sullenly, their eyes - dead and lifeless. And how they tend to gathers in small groups, usually on street corners. And especially when they sit on the sidewalk, weakly waving at you as you walk by, asking you for Brains.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, theyre asking you for change, not brains.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today they are, yes. Thats why I was only carrying a Daisy, not a Winchester.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, I will give credit for one thing Frank -
             <a href="http://franklintowers.typepad.com/your_daily_small_talk_/2014/03/to-jack-ryan.html" target="_blank">
              you have been warning people about this since March 27th.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             This just the beginning, Bob. And frankly, Im not worried about the Ebola as much as what come next. After the infection spreads. And they start injecting people with the "vaccination". Which reminds me. And I hope you dont mind, but as part of the Omega Man Protocol, you are about to get a few new roommates up there in my head.
            </p>
            <p>
             Say what?
            </p>
            <p>
             You heard me. Youre about to get a few new roommates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, Ive heard of people stocking up on food, water and ammunition in case of times of National Emergency, but imaginary voices? Really?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yup.
            </p>
            <p>
             Explain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, as everybody knows,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(novel)" target="_self">
              Colonel Robert Nevilles one weakness was his need for companionship.
             </a>
             It was loneliness which forced Vincent Price Robert Neville to invite the vampire chick into his house. Charlton Heston Robert Neville fell to Mathias and the Family because he trusted that chick with the keys to his apartment. And it was the loss of his dog, Sam, which ultimately brought down Will Smith Robert Neville. So, after studying those movies for years, I have been stockpiling imaginary voices to keep me company in the post apocalyptic world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, even by your standards, thats fucked up. You really should sleep for a little while.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ah, here they are now. Ladies, Gentlemen. Welcome. Id like you all to meet Bob Weir. Hes been staying here in my brain while he recovers from unknown circumstances. Bob, Id like you to meet the gang. Guys, why dont you all introduce yourselves to Bob and give him a quick run down on your areas of expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im Billy the Kid, and I will be advising Frank on how to shoot shit. Yee, hah. That was some mighty fine work with the bb gun yesterday, Frank.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im Ghengis Khan, and along with my friends Napoleon Bonaparte and Joan of Arc, we will be Franks tactical advisors. We are all experts in defeating giant hordes, just like the hordes of diseased and undead by which we shall soon be surrounded. Except Napoleon, who fucked up, but since theres little chance well be faced with the option of mounting a major campaign against the Soviets during the winter, weve decided to keep him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Weir, I am Ludwig Von Beethoven. Big fan. Lets have a sidebar when this is all done. I want to ask you why you and Barlow changed the lyrics to Black Throated Wind.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am Sigmund Freud. I will be in charge of maintenance here in Franks brain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Weir, Im Abraham Lincoln. I will be in charge of advising Frank on legal matters during the pending zombie apocalypse, as well as helping him rebuild society after we defeat these Barbarians at the Gate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Weir, Im Socrates. I too want to know about Black Throated Wind. Is it like Dust in the Wind?
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit, Frank. These are the imaginary voices youve been stockpiling for the long dread zombie apocalypse?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thats right, Bob. Gonna be an excellent adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hi Bob Weir. Hi Frank.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who are you two most excellent babes?
            </p>
            <p>
             Were the Princesses. We will be at your side as you drive around a post apocalyptic Miami in a bad-ass convertable, shooting at zombies while drinking craft beers.

             How about when he

            <p>
             I know. That was amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then when he
            </p>
            <p>
             And it all happened so fast.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wow. That was one of the coolest things Ive ever witnessed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Tatum could definitely beat up Matt Damon Jason Bourne.
            </p>
            <p>
             No shit. And maybe take the planet Klandathu, all by himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Frank, lemme ask you a question.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shoot.
            </p>
            <p>
             If somebody held a gun to your chest, do you think you have the skills to disarm your assailant like that?
            </p>
            <p>
             You mean like Mr. Tatum demonstrated?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah. Could you do that thing he did where he not only disarmed his assailant, but broke the bad guys arm, stove in his sternum and Joe Theismanned his knee? All in the blink of an eye?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, Bob. Not even close. That was some serious, next level shit we saw on Saturday. You gotta devote a lot of years of study before you even attempt that stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what would you do in that situation? If I had a gun, right now, pointed at your chest - what would you do?
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever you told me to do, Bob. Duh.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah but, lets say Im a member of ISIS, and Im holding a gun to your chest, telling you to dig your own grave because Im gonna behead you on camera. Would you fight back at that point? Or would you dig your own grave, without putting up a fight?
            </p>
            <p>
             So youre asking, who would win in a fight between me, and a member of ISIS?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah. Him holding a gun, you holding a shovel. And you know hes gonna cut your head off as soon as you finish digging your own shallow grave. What would you do?
            </p>
            <p>
             Dig slowly?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, Im serious.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dig slowly, all the while trying to convince the guy Id be willing to convert to Islam and join the Jihad if he lets me live? Then remind him that, given my American Passport, command of the English Language, jolly appearance and blue eyes, just how valuable I could be to Allah? Tell him, if he lets me live, Ill strap a bunch of C-4 to my chest and blow myself to smithereens at Fenway as soon as I get home?
            </p>
            <p>
             Baseball season is over. And he doesnt speak English, Frank. Im serious. What would you do? Would you try to take one or two of them with you, knowing you were gonna die anyway? Or would you go down without a fight? Frank, are you listening? Frank?
            </p>
            <p>
             Gimme a second here, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, are you crying?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Bob, I am crying. Hand me a Kleenex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wow, Im sorry. I didnt mean to upset you like this. Here's a Kleenex. Its got Aloe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeez. I apologize. I had no idea simply contemplating the scenario of your pending death at the hands of Muslim Extremists would make you cry like this.
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesnt, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, why are you crying?
            </p>
            <p>
             Im crying because you just reminded me that in todays world - no matter where you live on the planet, no matter what God you worship or what language you speak - the reality of the situation is that every man, woman and child across the globe is now forced to live in a world where

             Is it Saturday yet?
            </p>
            <p>
             No Bob, its only Friday. Man, youre really excited to see Larry Tatum.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell yeah. The dude is a 10th degree blackbelt. For real. Thats like, more bad ass than Jeremy Renner Jason Bourne, Matt Damon Jason Bourne and Daniel Craig James Bond combined. Are you gonna ask him my question?
            </p>
            <p>
             What question?
            </p>
            <p>
             You know, the one I asked you last night? While you were watching what the NY Times called ...
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/26/sports/baseball/derek-jeters-finale-yankee-stadium.html" target="_blank">
              the best blown save in Yankees history
             </a>
             ?"
            </p>
            <p>
             No Bob, I am not going to ask Larry Tatum if he thinks he could defeat the Borg all by himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why not?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, for one thing, as Gumby pointed out several days ago, only Honey BooBoo can defeat the Borg. And for another, Larry Tatum is Carols sensei. His being here is a big deal, and I plan on according him an inordinate amount of respect. Out of respect for him, and especially out of respect for Carol.
            </p>
            <p>
             And because hes a 10th Degree Blackbelt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Bob. Because hes a 10th Degree Blackbelt, and that makes him one of maybe three or four people on the planet who could kick anybodys ass. Anywhere, any time. Were talking Bruce Lee level skills.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mad nunchuck skills too, I bet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Probably. And bow hunting skills. Maybe even computer hacking skills.
            </p>
            <p>
             You think he could take Rex in a fight?
            </p>
            <p>
             Rex, founder of Rex Kwan Do?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, you should ask Larry Tatum if he has the strength of a grizzly, the reflexes of a puma and the wisdom of a man.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob, Im not quite sure you realize what a big deal it is to meet Larry Tatum, and witness his mastery of the martial arts. Or what a big deal this is to Carol. This is Carols sensei. Kinda like how

             No, Bob, I will not be wearing my Vote for Pedro shirt to the event.

             So, Frank. That was an interesting text message exchange you had last might. Whos Carol?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeez Bob, I really wish you wouldnt read my text messages.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I wish I could erase the image of you and the Yoga instructor getting it on with her pet llama from my memory, but that aint gonna happen either. Whos Carol?
            </p>
            <p>
             Carol is my martial arts instructor. She wants me to come meet her sensei, Larry Tatum, this Saturday. But you know all that already - you read the text exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
             How come you havent been going to your classes lately?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because I dont want you to experience what goes through my head during those classes. Not sure youd like it. And it might even jeopardize your sobriety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lotta mushrooms at those classes?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, Bob. Lotta revenge fantasies. Ugly shit you shouldn't be exposed to at this point in your road to recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like what?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, there are a lotta people on my shit list, Bob. People who I imagine Im beating the crap out of while I practice my kicks, throat punches and eye gouges.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like who? Whos on your shit list?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thats a pretty personal question Bob. Not sure I want to share the list.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cmon, lay it on me. You know I could find out for myself if I poked around here inside your head long enough. Tell me, whos on your shit list? Who do you fantasize about hurting while you practice eye gouges?
            </p>
            <p>
             All right, but this stays just between you and me: that person in line at Starbucks in front of me who orders the incredibly complicated drink, like a two Stevia 125 degree dirty chai with almond milk, extra foam, one pump regular vanilla, one pump sugar-free hazelnut; Megyn Kelly and pretty much everybody else at Fox News; Red Sox Fans; Creationists; little old ladies who use coupons then pay with a check at Publix; a few of my former bosses; one or two former colleagues; whoever was responsible for canceling Arrested Development, and Buck Showalter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Buck Showalter?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah. I ever run into that fucker hes a dead man. On account of how he treated Derek Jeter yesterday. Bringing in a relief pitcher to face him with a six run lead and nobody on base in what well may have been The Captains last at bat at Yankee Stadium.
             <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/madden-orioles-manager-buck-showalter-shows-derek-jeter-love-team-buries-yankees-article-1.1951992" target="_blank">
              That was bullshit.
             </a>
             
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. You know, Frank, I think everybody hates those people too. In fact, that was one of the more normal things youve said since I got here. Whats the deal with the Jedi mind tricks you two were texting about? Have you learned how to convince Imperial Storm Troopers that yours are not the droids they are looking for?
            </p>
            <p>
             I wish, but no. Most of my training over the past two years has been learning how to avoid getting into a fight in the first place. So, for example, if somebody should get all up in my face, the first thing Id do is tell him Look, buddy, lets not fight. I really dont want to go back to prison.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting. What if that doesnt work?
            </p>
            <p>
             You mean, what would I do if I actually got into a fight?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strike first. And without warning. Three quick shots, then run like hell. Which in my case, is more of a waddle than a run, but the principle is the same. One, two, three - then flee."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Elaborate."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Well, first thing I would do is pretend to scratch my right ear. You know, like I was thinking about something. From there, I would wallop him with a chop with my right hand to his Caratid artery, bend his knee backwards with a kick with my right foot, then finish him off with a left hook to his midsection, right on his liver. All the while screaming. Hes got a knife. Put down the knife. Hes got a knife.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, lets say this fight occurred in a bar, or out at Joe Robbie Stadium. As soon as I start screaming Hes got a knife, I have the moral high ground. Any good samaritans, be they off duty cops or whatever, will come to my aid because, as far as they know, some asshole just pulled a knife on me. As soon as you accuse somebody of pulling a knife on you, you can pretty much do whatever you want to him, like bash his brains in with a fire extinguisher, and you're the good guy in the fight. If a cop happens to witness it, the other guy will be the one who gets tased, not you.
            </p>
            <p>
             What happens when they find you the other guy didnt actually have a knife? What do you say then?
            </p>
            <p>
             Im a little shaken up at the moment, officer, so if you dont mind, Id really rather not talk about it until I speak to my attorney. All I can say is I was in fear for my life and did what I thought I had to do to defend myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. And the flashlight? Whats that all about?
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you really want to know?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, this is kind of cool. Maybe learning self-defense is the activity I need to become addicted to as a replacement for my current addictions. Lets go see

             Im here. Hang on a second, Ill be right with you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus Bob, did you just take another shower? Thats like, your 20th shower since we got out of Yoga class yesterday. You must have worked up quite a sweat.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imaginary voices dont sweat, Frank.
            </p>
            <p>
             So whats up with all the showers?
            </p>
            <p>
             Youre a dirty old man, Frank.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you mean?
            </p>
            <p>
             We aint doing Yoga again, thats what I mean.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why? What happened?
            </p>
            <p>
             That was some sick shit going through your head yesterday, and I got covered with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             What are you talking about?
            </p>
            <p>
             Im talking about the 45 minutes of disgusting and perverse fantasies you had running through your mind throughout that entire class.
            </p>
            <p>
             You mean like how I kept wondering what the instructor would look like in a Dolphins Cheerleaders outfit?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, Im talking about after that, when you started imagining you worked at Dominos, and you were delivering her a pizza, but she didnt have any money, but she was really hungry, so she asked you if there was any other way she could pay you for the pizza, and you said
            </p>
            <p>
             So what? She was hot.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus Frank. You really gotta lay off the porn. That was some disgusting shit you were thinking yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh gimme a break, Bob. It wasnt that bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really? Not so bad? What about the scene you imagined in your head where the two of you were interrupted mid-coitus by her pet llama? And what happened after that? That was just plain wrong, Frank. That poor llama.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, that part did get a little weird, I admit it. But the ending was pretty good, you gotta give me that much.
            </p>
            <p>
             You mean the scene where, after the two of you finished having strange, perverse and deviant sex, and you and she and the llama were eating the pizza
            </p>
            <p>
             and the rest of the Dolphins cheerleaders pop out of the closet and have a mad pillow fight to see who gets the last slice. Yeah, that scene.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, come to think of it, that was pretty hot."

             Dude, that was so uncool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob, Im so sorry. I completely forgot you were in here. You ok?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, but that was a close call. Dont do that again.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wont. Tell me, how did you escape?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, before you got up from your chair, I was hanging out in your Occipital Lobe. Thats the best place in your brain to watch TV. As soon as I realized what was going on, I fucking hightailed it to the Brocas Area of your Frontal Lobe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why there?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Brocas Area of your Frontal Lobe controls your speech, and you dont start slurring your words until youve had at least 8 beers. So I figured Id be safe there, at least for a little while.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am so sorry Bob. Like I said, I completely forgot about you. The good news is I only had two beers. And now we know, should I have another slip like that, you can always seek refuge in the Brocas area of my brain. Thats your bomb shelter, Bob, next time I start to get bombed. Which wont happen again. I promise.
            </p>
            <p>
             It better not. We have a deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             It wont Bob, trust me. I know what youre going through right now. Been there myself, after I got out of rehab in the late 80s.
            </p>
            <p>
             You were in rehab? Boy, I hope you got your money back from that place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fuck you, Bob. I quit drinking for two years. Two whole years, maybe closer to three, I dont remember. And it wasnt easy. I saw my only New Years Dead show sober, 1989-1990. There were a lotta temptations that night.
            </p>
            <p>
             New Years 1989, eh? You were at that show,
             <a href="http://www.dead.net/show/december-31-1989" target="_blank">
              when we celebrated the end of the decade?
             </a>
             Sober?
            </p>
            <p>
             And the night before. Sober as a judge for each, Bob. Thats why the inside of my head is the perfect halfway house for you right now. Together we can get you back up on stage, new and improved, better than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. Im actually mildly impressed. Although the fact you only managed two years is not particularly reassuring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever. Trust me, at the time, it was an remarkable accomplishment. Which reminds me, we gotta find you an activity to obsess over. Something to get addicted to, to replace whatever it is you were addicted to before. For me, it was birding.
            </p>
            <p>
             Birding?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah. After I quit drinking, I sublimated my self destructive and addictive personality disorders into compulsive and obsessive amounts of bird watching. Instead of staying up till four in the morning getting wasted, Id get up at four in the morning to go birding.
            </p>
            <p>
             Birding? Seriously?
            </p>
            <p>
             Birding is cool, Bob. Its a lot like going to Dead Shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             How so? Lotta acid?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. Birding is like going to Dead shows because its all about field identification. The more times you go birding, the easier it is to tell a Lesser Scaup from a Greater Scaup. The more Dead shows you attend, the easier it is to figure out if its gonna be a Scarlet Fire or a China Rider to open the second set.
            </p>
            <p>
             So you were one of those people, eh Frank? That guy in the crowd who always tried to be the first one to figure out the next tune by listening to me noodle on the guitar while we tuned up?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Bob, I was. And I was pretty damn good at it. I could hear a Victim or the Crime coming from a mile away. Lord knows I heard it enough times. Which brings me to the next similarity between birding and going to Dead Shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Giant tanks of nitrous oxide?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. Most times you go birding, you see pretty much the same birds. But once in a while, once in great while, you see a bird youve never seen before. Something really rare or obscure. Like a Mangrove Cuckoo or a Smooth Billed Ani. Same with Dead shows. Every now and then, you catch a tune youve never heard before, or that you guys hadnt played in years. And thats what keeps you going, be it birding or to Dead shows. The hope youll be in the right place, at the right time, and see something truly special.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. I hate to say it, but this all makes a lot of sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, whataya say, Ace - wanna start going birding with me?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think I like the Yoga idea better. More MILFS.

             We were. Right up until he laid a bombshell on me. Davey and Goliath. He thought he could bring Davey and Goliath.

             Right? And check this - Gumby wanted Davey and Goliath to live in my subconscious.

             No shit. Thats even more fucked up. Although, at least if they were in your subconscious, you wouldnt actually hear them.

             Lets stop talking about this Bob. Im hearing Goliaths voice in my head just thinking about hearing Goliaths voice in my head.

            <p>
             Really?
            </p>

             Yes. Just as quit for personal reasons is code for got fucking fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             No shit. I never knew that. So whats that mean as far as your hanging out in here?
            </p>
            <p>
             The counsellors at the clinic dont want me associating with anybody who might put my sobriety at risk. Why are you laughing?
            </p>
            <p>
             Im sorry, I shouldnt laugh. But thats kinda funny.
            </p>

             Whats funny about it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Its funny because youre fucking Bob Weir for fucks sake. Have your counsellors ever been to any of your concerts? Because when it comes to drugs, and the people who take them, your shows are Black Holes. This aint gonna be easy for you, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know. Backstage is even worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should stay here. Im pretty much retired as far as bad behavior goes. I dont even drink that much anymore. You know that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah but
            </p>
            <p>
             No buts about it. Youre staying. Ill even do a juice cleanse to rid myself of any residuals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. They did say they wanted me to stay in a halfway house for a month or so.
            </p>
            <p>
             Exactly. Think of my brain as a halfway house. A safe, supportive and nurturing environment to help ease your way back out into the real world. A layover, as it were, on your road to recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK. But you gotta work with me on this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob, I got your back. Im putting away the PAX as we speak, see?
            </p>
            <p>
             Gosh, Frank. Thats awfully nice of you. Thanks. One thing though. My counsellors say its a good idea for me to find something new to become addicted to. They say I should channel my addictive personality traits and need for endorphins into a new obsessive behavior. Like doing Yoga 14 hours a day. Or training for a triathlon. Building model railroads. Or finding Jesus. Would you be willing to join me if I choose to accept the only true Christ as my personal Lord and Savior?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Youre kidding right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course I am. Davey and Goliath, eh? In here? Wow. That's seriously fucked up. What was Gumby thinking? You gotta tell me how that convo went.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will, but right now Im trying to remember where I left my bong.

            </p>
            <p>
             Well, Frank, as you know, there are two kinds of people in the world, the prickly and the gooey. The prickly are rigid and uptight, analytical, and critical. The gooey are easygoing, flowing in the here and now, friendly and jolly. These two characters symbolize those two types of people. Prickle, the little yellow dinosaur/dragon with his spines, and Goo, the gooey, blue, flying mermaid.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do they fight? Are they gonna cause problems once they are inside my brain? Ive already got some serious inner conflicts as it is.
            </p>
            <p>
             "No, not at all. Goo is helpful and protective of Prickle, but never lets him know it. Prickle is concerned about Goos behavior, and always lets her know it as pointedly as possible. Goo can spread her wings and fly, and she spits goo balls at people who deserve it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ewwwmy head is a mess as it is. Is Goo gonna be spitting goo balls all over the place?
            </p>
            <p>
             "No, youll like Goo. She will make a wonderful addition to your brain. I remember this one time, Prickle was flying a biplane trying to shoot down the Red Baron

             Like Snoopy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, the Red Baron was a very common bad guy in the sixties. He symbolized Germany. As you know,World II ended in 1945, so it was still a very real, tangible event in the minds of most people in the mid sixties. Just like 9/11 is a very real, tangible event in most peoples minds now, even those who were too young to watch happen live on CNN. So anyway, where were we?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "You were telling me a story about Prickle and Goo."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Oh, so Goo jumps on the wing of the biplane, and Prickle asks her what shes doing, and warns her to be careful. The Baron tries to shoot down Prickles plane, and Goo spits goo balls at him from her place on the wing and blinds him, forcing him to crash land. Prickle takes the credit for defeating the Baron, and Goo lets him have it with a wink and a smile.

             Huh. Lets get back to Prickle and Goo later. What part of my brain does the Groobee want to inhabit?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Groobee goes everywhere I go, just like Pokey. This is non negotiable. Non negotiable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Except my subconscious. Thats off limits to everybody. We agreed on that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, your subconscious is off limits to everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good.
            </p>
            <p>
             Except Davey and Goliath. They will be staying in your subconscious.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whoa, hold on a second? Youre bringing Davey and Goliath?
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course. Why, is that gonna be problem?
            </p>
            <p>
             You bet it is. A big problem. Were talking deal breaker.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why? What do you have against Davey and Goliath?

            <p>
             So yesterday we talked a lot about the hive mind and collectives such as the Borg and the arachnids from the planet Klandathu. Tell me a little about your Omega.
            </p>
            <p>
             You mean Art? The brain inside of which I was born and raised?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, tell me about Art."
            </p>
            <p>
             Lets see. Where to begin. Art was born in 1921 in Detroit. His life took a tragic turn when his father was killed in a car accident soon after his parents divorced.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting. I lost my father to a heart attack when I was 12. Go on.
            </p>
            <p>
             After moving to California, Art was abandoned by his mother and her new husband and lived in a halfway house near Hollywood until age 11, when he was adopted by a renowned music teacher and composer at Pomona College. He taught Art to draw, paint and shoot film and took him on journeys to Mexico and Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus. His mother abandoned him? Thats fucked up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right? So anyway, Art served in World War II, conducting photo reconnaissance over North Africa and France.
            </p>
            <p>
             So did my Dad. He served in North Africa and France as a Major under Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers. You and I have a lot in common. Tell me more.
            </p>
            <p>
             After the War, Art moved to Hartford, Conn., where he studied to be an Episcopal minister
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit. Im from Connecticut. And I was raised as an Episcopal as well. This is kinda freaky.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the 1970s, Art studied Zen Buddhism, traveled to India to study with gurus and experimented with LSD and other drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit. In the 1970s, I studied nothing as well, and travelled to a shit ton of Dead shows to party with gurus and experimented with LSD and other drugs too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Art died in his sleep at his home in Los Osos, Calif in 2010, after battling repeated bladder infections. Instead of flowers, the family suggested contributions, in my name, to the Natural Resources Defense Council, of which Art was a longtime member. He was deep into the environment, long before it was cool. In fact, the reason I am green is due to his passion for the environment. You care about the environment as well, correct?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah. Ive worked for both the National Audubon Society and Trout Unlimited. But I dont recycle, I want to be real clear about that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, more energy is used collecting, sorting and reprocessing most recycled items than would be used in manufacturing new raw materials. I dont recycle either. So, what do you think? Can we move in? Can me and the gang be the next imaginary voices in your head?
            </p>
            <p>
             I dunno, dude. Sounds like you already are. But gimme some time to process this.

              Its kinda freaking me out.

            <p>
             Bob Weir sends his regards. I told him you were here, and that the interview seemed to be going well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope you passed along my warmest personal regards. What did he have to say about Levi Stadium?
            </p>
            <p>
             He said its nice once you get there, but it aint exactly convenient to Mill Valley. Fortunately, he went down on a party bus organized by his favorite bar,
             <a href="http://www.terrapincrossroads.net/" target="_blank">
              Terrapin Crossroads.
             </a>
             
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. I would have thought his favorite bar would be Sweetwater Music Hall."
             <a href="http://www.sweetwatermusichall.com/" target="_blank">
              <br/>
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             
             <a href="http://www.sweetwatermusichall.com/" target="_blank">
              Actually, it is.
             </a>
             That was a trick question. And you just passed with flying colors. Well done.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, Bob had some questions for you which he texted me. Ready?
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK, here goes. Bob wants to know, if Rambo were to fight Rocky, who would win?
            </p>
            <p>
             All Rambos, I-IV, defeat all Rockys, I-VI. But that would be a PPV Event worth paying for. Every fight would go the distance, 15 rounds, Rambo wins by decision, Rocky leaves the ring on a stretcher. Cut to shot of Rambo watching Rocky being carried out, before giving a look to Richard Crenna that says Ive done what you told me to do, but I didnt enjoy it, so please, can you finally leave me alone so I can cope with my PTSD in peace?
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's Bob's second question. Who wins a war between the Borg and the arachnids from the planet Klandathu?
            </p>
            <p>
             Both alien races are Collectives, with the arachnids from Klandathu taking their orders from the Brain Bug and the Borg Collective under control of the Borg Queen. Honestly, its tough to see the Borg losing to anybody in the Galaxy, except of course the Federation. That said, the Borg's greatest strength may be their only weakness.
            </p>
            <p>
             Explain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, as everybody knows, the Borg add the biological and technological distinctiveness of their adversaries to their own, forcing the oppositions culture to adapt to servicing them. So whatever you throw at them ultimately comes back to bite you in theass. For the arachnids from the planet Klandathu to even stand a chance, they gotta throw a wrench into that equation. Make the Borg assimilate Honey BooBoo for example.
            </p>
            <p>
             So youre saying, the arachnids from the planet Klandathu could defeat the Borg by forcing them to assimilate Honey BooBoo?
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps, but despite their name, I dont think the Brain Bugs on Klandathu are that smart. They got beat by fucking Doogie Howser for Petes sake. But I have it on good authority that the Honey Booboo maneuver is currently being taught at Starfleet Academy as an SOP against the Borg. Throwing Honey BooBoo into the equation is also being tested as a possible solution to winning the previously un-winnable Kobayashi Maru scenario.
            </p>
            <p>
             So is the Borg unbeatable? Or is there any alien race out there that could take them down?
            </p>
            <p>
             Theyre tough, thats for sure. Resistance is probably futile. Although the alien race which invades earth in "Live.Die.Repeat. Edge of Tomorrow. are pretty bad ass. While they are a hive mind species as well, their soldiers, the Mimics, are wiley. And their Collective is lead by the Omega. The Omega has some pretty impressive powers. Itd be a good fight.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob's third question: Ghostbusters versus the Three Amigos?
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting matchup. Ghostbusters definitely have the technological advantage Dont cross the streams, Ray", but if memory serves, little Neddie is a trick-shot artist. He might be able to draw his revolver and fire four shots before the GBs weapons power up. That would be another PPV worth paying to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob's fourth question: Frodo vs Fredo?
            </p>
            <p>
             Frodo would never dare mess with Fredo, at least not until MichaelCorleones mother dies in Godfather 2. After that, Frodo takes Fredo. Fredo couldnt even control his wife, and Frodo, well, Frodo always gets er done.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the last of the questions Bob wanted me to ask you: The population of Nicaragua vs the state of Kentucky? Civilians only, no armed forces.
            </p>
            <p>
             It all boils down to the home team. Nicaragua invades Kentucky, Kentucky wins in a blood bath. The civilian population of Kentucky probably has more weapons than the entire Armed Forces of Iceland &amp; New Guinea combined. Lotta Crystal Meth &amp; Oxys too. The only thing that concerns me is the number of Nicaraguans currently living in Kentucky employed as maids or gardeners and the like. They might prove troublesome given their intelligence gathering capability. On the other hand, if Kentucky invades Nicaragua, Kentuckians lose. Lotta heavy weapons floatingaround down there, most of it courtesy of the Reagan Administrationsefforts to defeat the Sandinistas back in the 80s. Although, properlymotivated, I think they could seize a city or two.
            </p>
            <p>
             Properly motivated? Explain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im pretty sure that the civilian population of Kentucky could capture and hold Managua, but only if they believed in their hearts that by doing so, it would put a stop to both Obamacare and the teaching of Evolution in public schools.

              answering my ad,
             </a>
             and agreeing to come in for an interview.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, thank you for having me. Were all very excited by this opportunity. For you to even consider us as a replacement for Bob Weir is quite an honor. Is he around by the way?
            </p>
            <p>
             No. He left to go back to Cali for a few days. Said he wanted to see the Niners play their first regular season game at the new park. Why do you ask?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, one of the guys in my band, Craig Chaquico, was the lead guitar player for the Jefferson Starship. He wanted me to ask Bob why he and Barlow changed the lyrics to Black Throated Wind. No biggie.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting. So if you get the job, we could talk about the Grateful Dead?
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course. In fact, before I was here inside your head for this interview, I was in St. Louis. I left St Louis, the City of Blues. On a screaming blue bender I'd rather forget. With no scars that show, the keys to the road. A couple of tens and some stale cigarettes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wow.
             <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/btwi.html" target="_blank">
              I guess that answers that question.
             </a>
             So, why do you want to be the next imaginary voice in my head?
            </p>
            <p>
             Im getting old, and like most old people, its time for me to move to Florida. Plus, you know how I feel about the cold.
            </p>
            <p>
             I sure do. You hate the cold so much can't even eat ice cream. Speaking of which, Im a little concerned about your bringing the Blockheads. G Blockhead and J Blockhead are both numskulls. And square thinkers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dont worry about them. While they know only one way to do anything: the hard way, often at someone elses expense, its usually at my expense. You shouldnt have to worry about them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, but theyre kinda racist.
            </p>

             Youre referring to the time the Blockheads put Indian children who have tee-pee heads into a press that turns their heads into blockheads, yes?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             That was a long time ago, and since then, I have enrolled them in several sensitivity training programs, including the same one Richie Incognito attended. They wont be a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. Speaking of Richie, you like sports?
            </p>
            <p>
             Imaginary voices love managing imaginary teams which compete in imaginary match ups, so Im deep into Fantasy Football and baseball.
            </p>
            <p>
             That makes sense. Tell me, I had RG3 as my starter yesterday. Hes likely out for the season. Ive got Eli Manning on the bench, but he kinda sucks this year. Tannehill is available, but after yesterday, Im not sure I trust him. Especially if Knowshon Moreno is going to be out for a while. Brian Hoyer is also available, as is Alex Smith. Who do you think I should try to pick up on waivers?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think you should hold off on even worrying about that until later in the week when theres more info available on the injury situations league wide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good thinking. I must say, you sound like the ideal candidate so far. What do you know about advertising?
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, a lot. I was working in advertising before I was even born, in fact. Big clients too, Budweiser and Coca Cola. Back in the fifties.
            </p>
            <p>
             No shit? I did not know that. Wow. Listen, do you mind if we take a break? I need to walk Monty. Can we pick this up when I get back? Or do you have to be somewhere else any time soon?
            </p>
            <p>
             No problem. We can continue this interview whenever you want. Im totally flexible.
            </p>

             Good Morning, Dr. Kissinger. Thanks for responding to
             <a href="http://miami.craigslist.org/mdc/roo/4656336587.html" target="_blank">
              my ad
             </a>
             , and taking time out of your busy schedule to come in for an interview.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you for having me.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, Dr. Kissinger, tell me a little about yourself and why you think you should be the imaginary voice in my head.
            </p>
            <p>
             I received my AB degree summa cum laude in political science at Harvard College in 1950. I received my MA and PhD degrees at Harvard in 1952 and 1954, respectively. I served as the National Security Advisor and later concurrently as the Secretary of State in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. After my term, my opinions and council is still sought by some subsequent U.S. presidents and other world leaders. Oh, and I also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973.
            </p>
            <p>
             Impressive to say the least, sir. Im curious, given your extraordinary credentials as an advisor to so many people of such global importance, why did apply for the position of imaginary voice in my head? Dont you have better things to do than talk to a nobody like me?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, there is no doubt that humanity could be better served by my being inside the head of somebody who actually matters, but Im sick of talking about global affairs. If one more person asks me about ISIS, or whether or not Russias invasion of the Ukraine constitutes an attack on NATO, Im gonna hurt someone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting. So, if you became the imaginary voice in my head, what would we talk about?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, we could talk about sports. Do you like basketball?
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger" target="_blank">
              In 1976 I became the first honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters.
             </a>
             Or we could talk about the Grateful Dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Dead?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes. Speaking of which, where is Bob Weir? I thought he was going to be here. I was hoping hed sign this Kingfish album I brought with me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bobs out walking Monty. Dr. Kissinger, you like the Dead?
            </p>
            <p>
             What, you didnt know that? I thought everybody knew that.

            </p>
            <p>
             Bob, Im ready to present my DripDrop advertising campaign now. Got some pretty good ideas I think will not only move a lot of units for you, but will also protect your reputation. You want me to do my presentation now?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lets hold off on that for the moment. Ive decided to stick around inside your head until you find a suitable imaginary voice in your head to replace me. For Montys sake. Where are you on that project?
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I was gonna go through the short list of the people who have responded so far and pick one to invite in for an interview. Apparently there must be some kind of housing shortage for imaginary voices, because I got a ton of replies to that ad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im not surprised. Todays antipsychotic medications have proven quite effective in driving imaginary voices from peoples heads. These new medications have created an epidemic of homelessness for imaginary voices, especially the ones that tell people to do really fucked up shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know. Thats why Im only considering applications submitted by imaginary voices with a proven track record of benevolent behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whos on your short list?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lassie, Mr. Clean, Phil Rizzutto, The Wizard of Oz, Henry Kissinger, Neil Armstrong, Homer Simpson, Vince Lombardi, Noah, Johnny Appleseed, Underdog, Sam Malone, Space Ghost, Omar Bradley, Charlie Brown, Macgyver, Elvis, Columbo, Sigmund Freud, the entire 1976 US Mens Olympic Hockey Team, Ben Franklin, Dilbert, John Wayne, Colonel Klink, John James Audubon, Rain Man, Robert Neville, Gumby, FDR, Galileo, Thomas Magnum, Barney Rubble, Jacques Cousteau, Spock, Paul Revere, Mickey Mantle and Flipper.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit. Thats your short list?
            </p>
            <p>
             I know, right? And it took me hours to cull it down to just those. Who do you think I should invite in for an interview? Im leaning towards Gumby. I think itd be cool to talk to Gumby every morning. Especially since, in his application, hes agreed to bring Pokey, Prickle &amp; Goo, the Groobee and the rest of the gang with him. So Id be getting, like, an entire menagerie of imaginary voices in my head for the price of one.
             <a href="http://www.gumbyworld.com/gumby-characters/" target="_blank">
              Quality imaginary voices too
             </a>
             , like Professor Kapp, who could help me with science. And Nopey. Monty and Nopey could play together. What do you think?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it might be a good idea for you to talk to Sigmund Freud instead. And as soon as possible.

             We are a pair of imaginary voices with centuries of experience currently looking for a new home. The inside of your head sounds ideal, however, we do have a few questions. How do you feel about harps? Do you prefer feet or cloven hooves? What is diameter of the narrowest portion of your ear canals? And can you provide a rough description of the condition of your ear canals, specifically as regards to the amount of wax? If they are inordinately waxy, would you consider providing a monthly stipend to cover our dry cleaning costs? Also, are you a Christian? Or a Muslim? While we do not discriminate based on religion, we currently do not provide actionable advice to Muslims.

             Morning Frank, you are up especially early this morning. You working on my DripDrop ad campaign I hope? Because my bags are packed, and I am out of here as soon as your DripDrop presentation is done. Especially now that I figured out, what with your having cable and all, I cant watch any Niners games here. You really should trade Comcast for Direct TV.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your bags are packed? But youre an imaginary voice in my head. Imaginary voices dont need luggage. Do they?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, they dont. It was a metaphor. I simply meant Im anxious to get out of here. But for the record, if imaginary voices did come with luggage, all the overhead compartments in your head are overflowing. Im amazed you can even stand up given the shear volume of emotional baggage youre carrying around.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fuck you Bob. And no, I am not working on your DripDrop campaign. I just finished posting a personals ad on Craigslist. Gonna find me a new imaginary roommate, somebody even cooler than you.

             Good morning Bob. I found some great open houses for us to visit today. One of them has, and I kid you not, I am reading this from the actual listing: Two swimming pools, one inside the other. That I gotta see."
            </p>
            <p>
             Im not going anywhere with you, ever again. I am only still here inside your head because Im waiting for you to tell me how to sell DripDrop. You owe me a presentation, and it better be good. Then I'm outa here. And I'm taking all your readers with me, too."
            </p>
            <p>
             But Bob
            </p>
            <p>
             "Fuck you Frank. I went through your computer last night while you were sleeping. I found this old email you sent. Youre a fucking monster Frank. Its one thing to try to kill off the imaginary voices in your head, but Monty?
            </p>
            <p>
             What? When did I ever try to kill Monty?
            </p>
            <p>
             Last year. Here, let me read to you this email I found:
            </p>
            <p>
             Halloween Horror Nights was awesome. You have no idea how cool it was being chased through the streets by 250 so people in theatrical zombie make-up when youre tripping balls. Awesome. Thats the good news. The bad news happened after I got home. Its kind of a funny story, but not really. It could have ended very, very badly.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I am asleep in front of the tv Sunday night around 7:30, and awoken by a noise I had never heard in my life. I look around, and there's Monty, lying in her dog bed. All of a sudden, she makes the noise again. Now, while I was up in Orlando, she stayed at the vet who did a dental cleaning and removed a couple teeth, so I figure it's her new 'bark'. I get up out of my chair, and look down only to discover that shes gone through my overnight bag, chewed through three layers of Ziploc bags, and eaten what was left of the chocolate bar I took to Orlando.The one I bought on Silk Road laced with mushrooms. I was wide awake and freaking out in seconds.For her part - she's laying in her dog bed looking at me with scared eyes. And making these unholy noises. Not noises of pain, not noises of alarm or hunger or anything I had ever heard come out of a dog's mouth. I was tempted to video her, just so I document the sound she was making, but I didn't want to be the guy who wasted time videoing his dog dying instead of trying to help her.
            </p>
            <p>
             My first thought was to rush her to the vet, obviously. But she is so freaked out I was afraid to move her. I thought about forcing hydrogen peroxide down her throat to induce vomiting, but I didn't think was a particularly good idea either.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I did exactly what I would have done if Monty were a human. I put on a pot of coffee, gulped down about half of it, and lay on the floor next to her. I rubbed her head &amp; stomach and told her how much I loved her, what a great dog she was, what a fine rabbit hunter she was when she was younger, how smart and loyal and excellent she was. All the while she's making these noises, trembling, looking like she wants to get up, but unsure if she was capable. I lay there on the floor petting, rubbing, and pouring on the love for maybe 3 hours. I actually thought about putting on some Grateful Dead for her, a Dark Star or a Stella Blue, but realized that that was dumb even by my standards.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, the noises subsided, and she got out of the dog bed and tried to walk around. 30 seconds later she stumbled back into bed. Shortly thereafter, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stayed up pretty much all night checking on her every now and then, just to make sure she wasn't going into a coma or something.
            </p>
            <p>
             I must have fallen asleep at some point, because next thing I know, it's morning, I'm laying on the floor next to her and she's licking my face. You can only imagine my relief. I took her on a walk, fed her, and she seemed fine.
            </p>
            <p>
             She's a-ok now, so as I said, it's kind of a funny story, but not really. Especially when you do the math. She ate exactly half of that chocolate bar, which means she ate 3.5 grams of shooms. As she weighs only 30 pounds, that would be the equivalent of a 180 pound human eating 21 grams of shrooms. 21 grams of shrooms. Can you imagine how fucked up youd be if you ate 21 grams of shrooms? And youre a dog?
            </p>
            <p>
             Makes you wonder - what do dogs think about when they trip? Something to ponder, next time youre tripping. Regards, F.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, Bob, I know. That wasnt cool. And not particularly well written either. But Bob, it wasnt like I fed her the shrooms. She tore through that overnight bag, and ripped through some serious amount of Ziplocs. But it is a true story. And I am not proud of myself for letting it happen in the first place. Still though, it ended well. And it could explain why you two are such good friends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. I never thought of that.
            </p>
            <p>
             You sure you dont want to go see the pool within the pool?
            </p>
            <p>
             Aw what the heck. Lets do it.

             running out of gas on the FDR Drive after a show at the Garden only to have a car pull up behind me with the four strangers who helped me push my car out of the middle of the road who turned out to have been the four people who were sitting behind me at the concert and it was all just one big happy coincidencethe 36 hours I spent wearing a hubcap on my head in Hampton Roads Virginia after putting 6 drops of Binaca in my mouth before my buddy grabbed it out of my hands because it wasnt Binaca, it was liquid LSD
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, I think Ive heard enough. Frankly, Im sorry I asked.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what did you and my Mom talk about while I was getting jello?
            </p>
            <p>
             She told me about Colton Chauncey, and your time with the

             in Guatemala.
            </p>
            <p>
             She what?
            </p>
            <p>
             She told me the whole story, Frank. Which is why, when we get back to Miami, I cant be an imaginary voice in your head any more. I dont want to be responsible for getting you into trouble. Well, not any more trouble than I already have. Did you really eat so many mushrooms you forgot who you were and tried to figure it out by reading your mail? Or did you just make that up?
            </p>
            <p>
             But Bob, you and me, we go to open houses and eat cheese cubes. That other voice in my head, we killed shit. And that was 21 years ago, 1993. This is completely different.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it? Is it really? Here. Your Mom gave me this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holy shit. My book.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ive only skimmed it, but the parts Ive read are very disturbing. Especially towards the end. Read page 395.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is it, as close as Ive been to having an out of body moment of complete, utter hopelessness and despair. You think this is fiction, but its not, this is really happening. The fucking heat, the guns, my ankles, these horrible Neo-Nazi Klansman, those grenades, all the dynamite. And having to kill that goat with my bare hands. Colt is the Anti-Christ. This is Hell. It wasnt me who answered that ad in Soldier of Fortune, it was this God damn character I created. Colt. Fucking Colt.
             <br/>
             Keep it together. I must keep it together. Colt and Chauncey. Im not important, nobody cares about me, this story is about Colt and Chauncey. When is Colt going to realize hunting isnt that much fun when hes the one being hunted? When is Chauncey going to kill Colt? Because thats what youre waiting for, right? Youre only reading this because you want to see how Chauncey kills Colt, right? Fuck you, evil reader.
             <br/>
             I must climb back behind the fourth wall. Keep it together, man. Make it funny. Got to be funny. Find the humor.
            </p>
            <p>
             See? Thats fucked up, dude. Youre killing goats and talking about whacking some imaginary dude named Colt. Who you blame for getting you involved with mercenaries or something. Your head is a fucked up place, Frank. And from the sounds of it, not a particularly safe place to be an imaginary voice. Like me.

             Most Trusted Man in America, eh? Did you hear how he was slurring his words? And I dont remember telling him he could have a party while we were gone. That sounded like a real rager he had going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, I dont know about you, but any party where people are literally trying to hang themselves because they're so bored is not exactly what I would call a rager. Besides, Marlin Perkins was there, and who better to take care of Monty than the beloved host of Mutual of Omahas Wild Kingdom?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, I guess youre right. Once he finished trying to get me to buy that term life policy, he did give us a pretty good report on Monty.

             Exactly. Relax. Your mom is resting comfortably, your dog is ok, the weather here in Maine is glorious. Be happy. In fact, in honor of Labor Day, and in an effort to interject some humor back into these posts - Im going to interview you. OK?

             Maybe youre right. I just like Lara Croft.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK, how about this one - who would win in a fight between the two Jason Bournes?
            </p>
            <p>
             Matt Damon Jason Bourne.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seriously? But Jeremy Renner Jason Bourne, he had all those meds that gave him super powers. Matt Damon Jason Bourne, he was just highly trained.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't know that for sure. And even if he didn't, I still say Matt Damon Jason Bourne would win. Dude had skills. How about this - if you put every James Bond in a steel cage match, who would win?
            </p>
            <p>
             Armed with their gizmos from Q? Or just straight up fight?
            </p>
            <p>
             Straight up fight.
            </p>
            <p>
             HmmmId like to say Sean Connery James Bond, just because Im old school. George Lazenby James Bond, hed be dead in a heartbeat. Fucking guy wore a kilt. Roger Moore James Bond, he was pretty tough in the first few movies, but I dont remember him actually ever punching anyone. Timothy Dalton James Bond, meh. Id say it would come down to Pierce Brosnan James Bond and Daniel Craig James Bond.
            </p>
            <p>
             And?
            </p>
            <p>
             And, without any Q Branch gizmos, Daniel Craig James Bond would win easy. But Pierce Brosnan James Bond had some pretty bad ass watches. Like the one with the super powered magnet. If he had that, I bet he could beat Daniel Craig James Bond in a cage match. Pierce Brosnan James Bond was wily.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK, how about this one: Daniel Craig James Bond vs Matt Damon Jason Bourne? Who would win that fight? Or wait, even better, Matt Damon Jason Bourne vs Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt?

             While youre thinking, lets call Walter Cronkite and see how Monty is doing. Ill put it on speaker phone.

             Good evening, Im Roger Grimsby, here now the news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Roger Grimbsy? I must have dialed the wrong number. Im looking for Walter Cronkite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Walter, its for you (pause) Good Evening, Im Walter Cronkite, reporting live from Miami Florida. In todays news
            </p>
            <p>
             Walter, its us - Frank and Bob - whats going on down there? Sounds like youre having a party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes I am. Joining me now live from your kitchen is Eric Sevareid . Eric?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is Eric Sevareid reporting live from Franks kitchen, where today tragedy struck not once, but twice. The first incident occurred when Andy Rooney attempted to use the ice maker in the refrigerator door. According to eyewitness reports, the torrent of ice cubes landed in Mr. Rooneys drink with such force as to cause much of his Scotch to spill on to the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh Christ - what was the second tragedy? Did somebody slip on the Scotch?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, the second tragedy occurred when several party goers including Tex Antoine, Chet Huntley and John Cameron Swayze attempted to hang themselves while listening to Andy launch into a 45 minute monologue about ice makers. Walter, back to you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks Eric, in other news, the fire department was summoned twice to the apartment due to Edward R. Murrows chain-smoking. No one was injured, and the smoke detectors have been removed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Walter, this is Bob Weir, how is Monty?
            </p>
            <p>
             Monty, the 17 year old beagle many are calling the greatest dog in the world, had another rough day, as the oppressive heat and humidity here in Miami continues to take its toll. For more on Monty, we now go live to Marlin Perkins, reporting from the balcony. Marlin?

             Hi Mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh Francis, dearest, so wonderful to see you. Thank you for coming all this way to visit. I hate for you to see me like this. All laid up in this silly hospital like this. Why, if Georgie Patton saw me malingering like this hed slap me in the face and order me right back up to the front 
            </p>
            <p>
             Ah, Mom, I brought a friend along for the trip. Mom, Id like you to meet
            </p>
            <p>
             Robert? Is that you?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hello Mrs. Towers. Nice to see you again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Robert Weir, you turn straight around and go find a nurse to shave off that ridiculous beard. You look like a member of the Taliban.
            </p>
            <p>
             You two know each other?
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, your mother and I have been friends ever since she became concerned about the number of concerts you were attending back in the 70s. She was afraid you might be joining some sort of cult. When did you and I first meet, Mrs. Towers?
            </p>
            <p>
             September 5, 1979. It was after the sound check at Madison Square Garden.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Mom - how... 
            </p>
            <p>
             Robert, you tell the story. Im still having a little trouble breathing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, your mother convinced everyone she was Brents mother, and wanted to talk to her son. Seeing as none of us knew Brent very well back then, we just assumed thats who she was. So me, Jerry, Phil, Mickey and Bill all met with her and talked for hours. She just wanted to make sure we werent going to turn you into a devil worshipper or a communist or anything like that. The best part was when Brent first met your mom. He was so wasted it took him twenty minutes before he realized he wasnt talking to his own mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Such a sad story about Brent. Died just as the band was really hitting their stride. All those fabulous shows there towards the end of his life, with the Help-Slip-Franks and the St. Stephens. And then poor Jerry. Such a nice boy, that Jerry Garcia. So polite. And he had the most wonderful laugh.
            </p>
            <p>
             MomIm speechless.
            </p>
            <p>
             Francis, I just wanted to make sure you werent getting involved with the wrong element. Its what any decent parent would have done. Now Robert, before I had this blasted congenital heart failure, I was listening to the 4/20/13 show in Port Chester on Sirius. Horrible performance, simply horrible. The song selection was good, eclectic to say the least, but the tempo. My word, if you played any of those songs any slower, itd be like listening to sheet music.
            </p>
            <p>
             Youre right, Mrs Towers, as Furthur, we do tend to play at a much slower pace than you are used to. But that Port Chester run was not one of my finer moments. I had
             <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/bob-weir-falls-onstage-during-furthur-show-20130426" target="_blank">
              a little incident
             </a>
             during the last show.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh Robert, if I had a dollar for every time one of my children had an oopsy daisy in Port Chester, NY, Id be a billionaire. Francis used to spend every night in Port Chester back when the drinking age was 18. How many times did I have to bail you out of that horrible little jail when you were growing up, Francis?
            </p>
            <p>
             "Mom, please. Do you really have to tell that story again?"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Robert, every time I drove Francis home from the drunk tank in Port Chester, I used to tell him "Francis - I swear. If you died tomorrow, Heaven forbid, the lede in your obituary is going to read Francis Frank Towers, who resided in Banksville, NY and, from 1 am to 4 am each night, Port Chester, NY, died today
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank, I bet you didnt know that your mom helped bring Vinny up to speed when he first came on board. She flew all the way to Cleveland help him get ready for his first show with the band.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh Robert, youre too kind. I am afraid I wasnt much help. All those years as a concert pianist could not prepare me for that thing he called his keyboards. Darned contraption wasnt any bigger than a backgammon board. Robert, would you like a lemonade?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, very much Mrs. Towers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Say Francis, would you be a dear and go down to the cafeteria and bring us some lemonade? And see if they have any of the red jello today. Or the green. And take your time, Robert and I have some catching up to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure thing, Mom. Ill be right back.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now Robert, you're not wearing those horrid little cut off shorts any more, are you? And whats with your canceling all your shows through the end of the year? Are you ok? Are you getting enough electrolytes?

            </p>
            <p>
             Are you kidding? No way in Hell I was gonna leave Monty alone with Tony Robbins. Fucking lunatic. And besides, now that the situation with your mom has gotten worse, well, I figured you could use the company. You seemed pretty shaken up by that phone call last night.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks Bob. Yeah. There are seven words you dont want to hear in the middle of the night when it comes to your 94 year old mother: Ambulance, congestive heart failure, hospital, resting comfortably. Thanks for coming, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             No problem. So tell me about her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mom? Lets see. Born in 1920, upstate New York, promising concert pianist until she met my dad, they got married, she served in the USO while he fought in WW II, started making babies as soon as the war ended, raised 5 kids, and worked at the New York Botanical Garden after my dad died back in 1972. Been in a nursing home since they had to amputate one of her legs about ten years ago, but her mind is still sharp as a tack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting. Shes seen a lot of shit in her lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
             And she remembers it all. From her first ride in a horseless carriage, to the advent of commercial aviation, to helping my dad fill sand bags for the bomb shelter he was building in our basement during the Cuban Missile Crisis, to Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dang.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob, I have a question for you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shoot.
            </p>
            <p>
             You and I just flew on a Jet Blue flight from Fort Lauderdale to Boston, rented a car, stopped for a lobster roll in York, Maine, and are now about only 34 miles from the hospital - yet throughout this entire trip, not one single person has recognized you. How is that possible?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, for one, The Grateful Dead have been a huge part of your life, and the lives of your friends, for the past 40 years. But 98% of the rest of the planet have no idea who we were, and who I am. And two, just like when we went to those open houses a while back, most of the people who do know who I am, just assume theyre having a flashback when they see me. And finally, Frank, dont forget - Im not really here. Im just an imaginary voice in your head.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh yeah, right. Youre just an imaginary voice in my head. I keep forgetting. But wait, if youre not really here, does that mean I just left Monty all alone in my apartment? Because if youre an imaginary voice, that means
            </p>
            <p>
             Relax. I may be an imaginary voice in your head, nothing more than a manifestation of the stress caused by your dog and your mom both nearing the end of their runs at the same time, but no. You did not leave Monty all alone. Shes in good hands, being watched by the most trusted man in America.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh thank God. I was worried there for a second. But youre right. I saw it with my own two eyes. Thanks Bob, I thought I was losing my mind there for a second. Youre right, I did not
             <br/>
             leave Monty all alone. I left her with Walter Cronkite.

             Hi Frank. Nice to see you again. Don't worry about a thing. I will take great care of Monty while you go see your mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tony Robbins? Are you fucking kidding me? There is no way in hell I'm letting you stay here and take care of Monty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh gimme a break. So I had a little hallucination. Big whoop. It was my birthday. And you practically forced me to eat that damn 2c-b.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, fine. But after you ran screaming out of here, did you really have to bang on every single apartment door on all 20 floors of this building asking people if by any chance they were St. George? And if so, could you borrow their sword? A lot of people were quite disturbed by that, myself included. Thank God I am one of only two people in the building who speak English or you'd be in jail right now, Tony"."
            </p>
            <p>
             I swear. I will be on my best behavior. Without all those pesky hallucinogens coursing through my veins, I can see why Bob went to such great lengths to get me to watch her for you. Monty is the greatest dog in the world, and I will take great care of her. And I promise, no drugs this time.
            </p>

             Bob, I am flattered you want to come with me to see my Mom. Lord knows, I could use a friend right now, even an imaginary one. But Tony Robbins? Seriously? You expect me to leave Monty alone with Tony Robbins while we go to Maine? Didn't you read the post about the last time he was here?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nobody reads your posts, Frank. But at least I looked at the picture and read the quote. Hes Tony Robbins for Petes sake - and you have no idea the amount of strings I had to pull to get him to house sit for you on such short notice. What could possibly go wrong?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll tell ya what Bob, you read the post. Given your obvious affection for her as well, if you're still comfortable with leaving Monty alone with Tony Robbins for the next few days, you can come meet my Mom. But you gotta read the whole post. Deal?
            </p>
            <p>
             Deal.
            </p>

             Frank, are you ok? Youve been curled up on the floor of the kitchen in the fetal position for three straight days. Is this some weird trance state that ad people go into when they create?

             What? Im genuinely concerned. You havent written a thing in days.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, I meant that literally. Last night, and the night before, you kicked me in the teeth by accident when you got up to get a drink of water. Now leave me alone.

             Is this about your trip home to Maine to see your Mom this weekend? Frank? Answer me. Answer me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oww. Stop kicking me. Yes, it is about my trip to Maine. And Monty. If I could figure out a way to say something funny about having a 94 year old mother and 17 year old beagle who are both struggling at the moment I would, but I cant. Nor have I been able to think of a single funny thing to say, about anything, for three straight days, which only makes me more depressed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there anything I can do to help?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now that youve stopped kicking me, no. Although there is one thing.

            <p>
             You name it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Go into my office, poke around this site, and post a link to something that you think doesnt suck. Try to find something vaguely funny, so I can conclude this post with something to reward folks for taking the time to read this far with something entertaining.

            <p>
             Good afternoon Bob. Are you ready for our meeting?
            </p>
            <p>
             I sure am. Should I wake up Monty?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nah, it wouldnt be a real advertising meeting without at least someone in the room being sound asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alrighty then. Lets do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks Bob. Here we go. As you know, last week the NY Times ran a story about a new product,
             <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/hydration-powder-attracts-rock-musicians-as-investors/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">
              DripDrop, which you have both endorsed and invested in.
             </a>
             Shortly thereafter, you appointed Your Daily Small Talk as your ad agency. For which we are most grateful.
            </p>
            <p>
             Youre boring me to death already,
            </p>
            <p>
             Im just returning the favor for the gazzillion times you made me suffer through Lost Sailor, so shut the fuck up and let me do my thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry. Go on.
            </p>
            <p>
             At first, creating a campaign for DripDrop seemed like the easiest assignment imaginable. However, over the weekend I did some very preliminary market research.
            </p>
            <p>
             And?
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember that guy, in the Dead Movie, who goes on and on about how he hates the fact theyre making a movie about the Dead, and how it just goes to prove what a bunch of sellouts the band has become?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, its right before we cut to Sugar Mags. Whats he got to do with anything?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well,apparently heis not only alive and well, but theres a lot more like him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Explain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the weekend, I invested a few bucks in an effort to drive traffic to this site by running some ads on Facebook. I wasnt selling anything, wasnt trying to profit in any way, I was simply trying to make a few folks laugh.
            </p>
            <p>
             And?
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a very telling experience. As in, a lot of people telling me to go fuck myself. Including some woman in Seattle who Im reasonably certain would bash my brains in with a Seahawks helmet if she had the chance."
            </p>
            <p>
             So what does this mean for me, and DripDrop?
            </p>
            <p>
             It means your celebrity status is both a blessing and a curse. Everybody who knows who you are, loves you. Which is good. But most everybody who knows who you are, also hates commercialism. Which is bad. So anything we do to promote your product that even vaguely resembles traditional advertising, marketing or sales would be the kiss of death. Which isnt to say it cant be done, but we gotta be real smart about how we do this, Bob.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huh. I never knew Deadheads hated advertising so much, especially given the prices folks are willing to pay for some of the ads we did back when our agency was Alton Kelley.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alton was a genius, Bob. Me, Im just trying to prove to you that Im not a hack. And sell some DripDrop for you. Well get er done, dont worry, it just aint gonna be as simple as I first thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wow, you really put some thought into this. And it actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Do you always do this kind of research on Facebook?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, I only used Facebook this time because people genuinely like you, Bob. And the comments people wrote were, for the most part, thoughtfully written and intelligent observations which reflected their genuine affection and regard for you. You're very beloved, Bob. And people are very protective of you, your reputation and image. However, Im pretty sure the same would not be said of the comments I would have gotten regarding t

             Did I ever tell you about the time we couldnt find Brent?

             No, Bob, you havent.
            </p>

             I think it was Lewiston, or maybe Oxford Plains - a big outdoor show in a tiny little town in Maine. Anyway, its like an hour after we were supposed to go on, late enough that people were actually starting to notice that the concert hadnt started yet, and we cant find Brent anywhere. We were just about to cancel the show, when this giant stretch limo shows up. Out pops Brent, dressed head to toe in a full on Kiss costume. Make-up and everything. Poor Jerry, hed been hitting the tar pretty hard that day, and as soon as he saw Brent, he totally lost it. Started rolling around on the ground, screaming Wheres the God damned motorcycle, wheres the God damned motorcycle? I think he thought Brent was the Grim Reaper. So anyway, once Jerry settled down a little, the rest of us all look at Brent and were all like Dude, what the fuck? Why are you dressed like Gene Simmons? And Brent says

             Bob, hate to interrupt, but its getting weird again. Youre a fictitious voice in my head, telling me a made up story about something that never happened. I am concerned for my sanity. Especially after our convo yesterday. Dont get me wrong, Im grateful for your teaching Monty to read, but Id prefer it if your being here this summer does not turn me into another David Berkowitz. So, Bob, can we try to keep our convos a little more reality based?
            </p>
            <p>
             No problem. From now on, we will confine our imaginary conversations to imaginary events that actually happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks. My sanity hangs by a very slender tendril, so I appreciate your help not severing it any futher. So lets keep it real. Speaking of which, that was real fun yesterday. Thanks again for taking me open house hopping with you. I can see why you like to pop in on those. Did you have fun?
            </p>
            <p>
             Meh. This town has a lot to learn about cheese cubes if you ask me. And whats up with this Prosecco crap? Granted, Im a Mill Valley kinda guy, but since when do you greet your guests at an open house by offering them a plastic cup of Martini &amp; Rossi? Seriously, even Pig Pen wouldnt drink that shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Welcome to Miami, Bob. Were you a little surprised nobody recognized you? Except for that one guy, who dragged us into his bed room so he could show you his tie dye shirt?
            </p>
            <p>
             Not at all. I try to hit at least 8 open houses a month, and I get recognized at only about four or five all year. I think its because the only people who know who I am have taken so many drugs they just assume that if they see me at their open house, it must just be another one of those pesky flashbacks. I tell what did bother me about yesterday, other than the shitty cheese cubes and bogus sparkling wine, was all the people who assumed that you and I were a couple.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh come on Bob, were in Miami. Its 2014. Two guys show up at at an open house, giggling a lot, of course people thought we were gay. Frankly, Bob, Im a little surprised you just said that. Sounded borderline homophobic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hey, I got nothing against gay guys. But I did resent the fact that everybody thought we were couple, thats all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because that meant I had a really ugly boyfriend.

             Morning Ace. Mind if I run a few taglines by you?
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure, but I want Monty to hear them too. Lemme go grab her. I think shes out on the balcony reading
             <em>
              Infanterie Greift An
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Hang on, Bob, are you telling me you taught my dog how to read? How?
            </p>
            <p>
             After you went to bed last night, we watched Patton. After that scene, the battle of El Guettar, Monty turned to me and said I want to read Rommels book, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shit, weve watched that movie together a million times. She never mentioned anything to me. But how exactly did you teach a dog to read?
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, here she is now. Monty - Frank has some taglines for DripDrop. Put your focus group hat on and lets see if hes the hack everybody says he is.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know what? This all getting a little too weird. Lemme work on the taglines some more, and well circle back to this Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             So thats it? This is your post for today? This is comedy? Because I gotta tell ya,
