          We are sure, like us, youd like to be more data-driven and to try make every decision based on informed insights.
         </p>
         <p>
          But its tough. So many growth managers struggle to incorporate data into their day-to-day decision-making. Its sometimes even hard to know just where to start.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thankfully there are some gals and guys who have already aced this stuff. They know the tips and tricks to building calculated, educated, data-driven growth strategies.
         </p>
         <p>
          To help you get better acquainted with these data-driven heroes (as we like to call them!), we have profiled 5. I hope each one can serve as some inspiration to up your data-driven marketing game and become a data-driven hero in your own right.

          Kiva have 4-5 Concurrent New Product A/B Tests at Any One Time
         </h1>
         <p>
          Lets start with
          <a href="http://www.kiva.org/home" target="_blank">
           Kiva
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          This non-profit organization may not seem like an obvious example of a data-driven hero. However, they are meticulous in their use of data and it is helping them make smarter, better decisions for their business.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data driven heroes" class=" aligncenter wp-image-1473" height="605" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/home_0228_updated.jpg" width="553"/>
          They outlined this in a blog post titled 
          <a href="http://blog.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/06/11/doing-our-homework-to-create-great-user-experiences" target="_blank">
           Doing our homework to create great user experiences
          </a>
          . Within the post, Abe Wallin, the businesses designer delves into their process of data collection for the design team. As well as the reasons why they do it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Insightfully a statement that Abe makes in the intro is
          <i>
           Nearly every project we undertake can benefit from user research.
          </i>
          We think this is such a valuable mindset for a business and even more importantly, Kiva actually act on it.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data driven heroes" class=" aligncenter wp-image-1474" height="457" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/kiva.jpg" width="612"/>
          Before they start designing a feature, they reach out to customers through interviews and surveys. They survey thousands and interview their customers to better understand what their user base needs. Its the beginning of the building process that guides them about what they should be doing and how they could satisfy their customers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then they move on to usability studies, where they monitor users interacting with their early stage products to
          <i>
           evaluate how successful a product or feature is in meeting a goal.
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          The final stage is to A/B test to see if the feature built is meeting the desired goals. At any given time, Abe says they are running four or five design tests and these determine whether they launch or go back to the drawing board.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a perfect step by step way to be data-driven in your product roadmap. Kiva attempt toprove or disprove assumptions and leave as little as possible to chance.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no rushing to build a whole product that may or may not work. Instead, its all done through collecting data on their users at every stageso that the final product performs at its best.
         </p>
         <h1>
          Status Page increased Signup Conversions by 311%
         </h1>
         <p>
          To use the words of Status Pages founder Steve Klein their
          <i>
           conversion rate was terrible
          </i>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The business needed to do something about it. So they got
          <a href="http://blog.statuspage.io/how-we-increased-our-conversion-rate-by-311-percent" target="_blank">
           serious with data
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Perceptively, they realised that to increase their conversion rate they had to first discover why people werent converting. To do this, they did some heavy quantitative and qualitative research.
         </p>
         <p>
          First, they trawled through their analytics and started to try and figure out how many people were actually arriving on the site and at which point in the sign-up process were they losing them.
         </p>
         <p>
          They observed prospective users on the site, monitoring their behaviour to see where the site was faltering. They also asked their current users to offer up opinions on what they thought of the product as well as looking through old request emails for patterns.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data-driven  heroes" class=" aligncenter wp-image-1475" height="342" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/funnel.png" width="512"/>
          This detective work gave them a tremendous amount of insight and Steve really saw the value in it:
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">
          <i>
           For us, there was so much low-hanging fruit in watching a bunch of people check out our marketing site. I suspect theres a good amount of diminishing returns there, but if youve never done it, the value you get out of it is tremendous.
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          With this abundance of data, they set about using it to make their site better.
         </p>
         <p>
          Perhaps the biggest lessons Status Page learned was how confused their potential users were. As Steve stated:
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">
          <i>
           One of the biggest reasons visitors dont convert is that they dont understand what they are about to sign up for.
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data driven heroes" class=" aligncenter wp-image-1477" height="357" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/statuslbla.gif" width="635"/>
          To rectify this, they made quite a few changes  inserting social proof, quotes from users, tried to make the onboarding process better and adding screenshots and video.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, after implementing the changes, there was amazing payoff for all the hard work as
          <b>
           their conversion rate increased by 311%
          </b>
          .
         </p>

          Crazy Egg Got A 64% Conversion Improvement from Customer Research
         </h1>
         <p>
          Crazy Egg are serious when it comes to conversion rate optimization. They are constantly striving to make their website just that little bit better each and every day.

          , there have been numerous tests written about outlining their endless improvements.
         </p>

           One example
          </a>
          of this that we loveis Crazy Eggs tests to improve the conversions on their site. Like any true Data-Driven Hero, they started the whole process by diving deep into data.
         </p>
         <p>
          Like the previous example Status Page, they decided to go to the best source  their customers. They interviewed existing users and people who didnt convert and asked their opinions of the site and what influenced their reasons for converting.
         </p>
         <p>
          This tossed up some interesting tidbits including people being unclear about what the product actually was, reservations about the price, confusion about the difference between Crazy Egg and Google Analytics and misunderstanding about features.
         </p>
         <p>
          Cleverly, they also went straight to a source that knew their users best  the support team. This gave insight into what customers were actually asking and how these questions were being answered.
         </p>
         <p>
          <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v3f-2WG7ONc?feature=oembed" width="740">
          </iframe>
         </p>
         <p>
          The results pointed them in the direction of an explainer video. Instead of what was once just text and images, now was a two and a half minute video showing off the product, placating customers reservations and providing all the essential information a customer would need.
         </p>
         <p>
          And the results spoke for themselves as Crazy Egg got a 64% boost in conversions from this change.
         </p>
         <p>
          Impressive results from a single video. But its an important lesson as Crazy Egg learned that not all their visitors
          <i>
           process information the same way.
          </i>
          Although, the video encapsulated the same message as the image and text that was already on the page, not everyone responded to this and the data proved it. They needed to explain their product better and through different media and it worked!
         </p>
         <h1>
          Hootsuite Used Data for Better Segmentation on the Path to 10 Million Users
         </h1>
         <p>
          Hootsuite were undergoing a transformation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Their product started as a free service but in 2010 decided to become Freemium with four premium tiers. However as
          <a href="https://rjmetrics.com/customers/hootsuite" target="_blank">
           RJ Metrics reports
          </a>
          , it wasnt working as well as theyd hoped. As Daniel Mathews, Data Analytics Manager at HootSuite stated:
         </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">
          <i>
           We experienced a significant dropoff in both free and paid signups. We could see right away that we didnt package it properly.
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          To fix this, they delved into data. They looked into their customers usage patterns to see what was affecting the businesses strategy.
         </p>
         <p>
          They decided to then separate their customers into two groups. It consisted of a 5% paid pool of business customers and a 95% pool that were casual users. And then segmented customers based off their usage.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data-drien heroes" class=" aligncenter wp-image-1478" height="453" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Hootsuite-Plans-And-Pricing.png" width="624"/>
          After a few cuts of the numbers, they found what distinguished a casual user from a business user and what features each group used. This enabled them to create a new tier system that reflected what their customers were actually doing.
         </p>
         <p>
          The research paid off as free and paid sign-ups began to rise. Hootsuite now have over
          <a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/10-million-users/" target="_blank">
           10 million users
          </a>
          . Using data allowed them to build a much clearer understanding of their customers behaviour and in turn build a pricing plan that accurately reflected this.
         </p>
         <h1>
          TheHOTHs data proved every customer is different
         </h1>
         <p>
          Like so many other businesses TheHOTH assumed that their potential customers would want as much information as possible on the landing page. And their landing page reflected this as it was long and had everything a customer would need to know.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, even though they were getting a steady stream of traffic they just werent converting.
         </p>
         <p>
          So they
          <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/minimal-homepage-increased-leads-seo-service-company/#iLzoxvFTYdCerPqI.99" target="_blank">
           decided to test that original assumption
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The first few initial tests provided a little bump but nothing significant. They needed something more.
         </p>
         <p>
          They got the answer when they started to look at their data. Intriguingly, analysis showed that most of their customers were coming from referrals, word of mouth and direct search. This pointed out that people werent coming to their site blind. Instead, most visitors knew information about the company already.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, there was an opportunity to skip the info and just go straight for the conversion on the homepage.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="data-driven heroes" class="aligncenter wp-image-1479 size-full" height="597" src="http://www.sparkpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/the-hoth.png" width="414"/>
          After this revelation they decided to do a dramatic split test. Over a period of 30 days they compared the original versus a new minimal designed landing page to see what their customers would react best to.
         </p>
         <p>
          The results were staggering as the minimal page increased conversions from 1.39% to 13.13%.
         </p>
         <p>
          Overall, this is an interesting case study. Especially when contrasted with the previous Crazy Egg and Status Page examples as their research suggested opposite outcomes.
         </p>
         <p>
          It just shows that you cant assume best practices from other businesses will apply to your own.
         </p>
         <p>
          If youre searching for the truly game changing wins, an exploration of your data is often the best place to start.

              Theres a lot of inspiration here. What roles do you think semantic and cognitive tools will be playing this year. We rolled out an API, Alchemy has theirs (and its a part of Watson now, too), what is the landscape going to look like at the end of 2015, as the vanguard of technical marketers starts getting clever with things like sentiment?
