            It is a good example of picking out a unique detail that speaks to the landscapes defining features; in this case its dry, gray mud spines and the amazing contrast in color that these sandstone blocks offered, says Lowe, who was accompanied Oliver, Schusler, and

            To ride this area, you should be pretty comfortable on a mountain bike, notes Lowe of the expert terrain. But if you know how to ride single-track, the rims of the rolling dunes around Cainville would be great fun to ride.

            "I really wanted to shoot a photo from the helicopter, right above Travis, as he was riding a line, but it was very difficult to coordinate because there was another heli in the air shooting with a Cineflex camera," recalls Serfas. "We worked out that if our helicopter hovered above the line Travis was going to ride, then the other Cineflex heli could maneuver around us without a collision."

            As Travis mentally prepared himself to ride the line, Serfas rose about a hundred feet above him and waited. "The other helicopter practiced their move around us, making sure they could still get the shot they needed," he says. "The sun was setting fast so the director, Curt Morgan, called for Travis to drop into the line, and as he made his second turn down the mountain I snapped this shot."

While the snow conditions were perfect, the winds were so strong that most of the ski lifts were shut down. We were lucky enough to get one of the only gondola rides up the mountain that day, recalls Hindert. This section is considered in-bounds in an unpatrolled area. Once we entered the shelter of this forest, we had the protection and solitude to session to our hearts content.

We lined up 40-foot airs through fallen trees and bounced down pillow lines that would be unrideable on any other day. We certainly accomplished everything we wanted to doand then about tenfold more.

            at dusk. The 200-foot-deep gorge is spanned by two bridges. The upper bridge is just above the tallest, steepest ice climbs in the park, which allowed me to place a battery-powered strobe on that bridge. Using a boom arm, I could then position the flash head out over the ice climb itself to illuminate the climb and the climber.
           </p>
           <p>
            After securing permission from the park and getting everything set up, it was just a matter of taking a few test shots to dial in the exposure. I could easily adjust the flash output from the wireless transceiver on the top of my camera, and then it was just a matter of finding the right moment, Clark says. We waited until just before dark to shoot this image so that I could easily overpower daylight with the flash. Because it was getting dark, and because I wanted to use a shutter speed that would allow the ambient light to bleed into the image, I used a tripod on the tiny ledge I was positioned on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The conditions were cold, but that's to be expected when your subject is climbing ice. Setting up the lighting wasnt particularly difficult, Clark says, but he did have to tether everything to the bridge for safety reasons.

You still have the option to turn back, but you continue anyway. Then, at that moment right as you go off the lip, it all just goes away.

"I had forgotten my chest harness that day, so I had to deal with my split-board A-framed pack while I got my camera out." But Beyer, who has been shooting adventure sports professionally for eight years, wasn't about to let that prevent him from getting the shot.

            For some photographers getting a particular shot can become an obsession. That was the case for
            <strong>
             Fredrik Schenholm
            </strong>
            , who made numerous attempts over years to get this shot of
            <strong>
             Oscar Hbinette
            </strong>
            skiing down a mountainside at night in Kamchatka, Russia, with an erupting volcano in the background.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2008, Schenholm and a friend were on Mount Cotapaxi in Ecuador when a neighboring volcano began to erupt, and it was then that the idea for the image came to him. I knew right then and there that it would be possible to capture an image combining both skiing and a volcanic eruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            To get the shot an immense amount of preparation and luck would be needed. The image he had in mind would require an eruption and both Schenholm and a skier being ready to hop on a plane at a moment's notice. But volcanoes dont always cooperate, and predicting when they will erupt is tricky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every morning and every evening I checked all the volcano blogs and volcano-monitoring websites available. This gave me a pretty good clue of the volcanic activity around the globe," says Schenholm, who attempted to get the shot at Iceland's Grimsvtn and made several attempts at Italy's Mount Etna. "But the volcano Tolbachik started its eruption in November of 2012two weeks after Oscar and I bought our plane tickets to Kamchatka. That was a nice welcome gift. I was really worried [that] in the coming months the eruption would stop. But it didnt, and we were finally able to get the shot.

Originally we were thinking about riding there in the summer, but when we saw pictures of the creek [in] the winter, we knew it would be a perfect location to try winter wakeskating. It took a good bit of preplanning to pull off the run, including setting up poles in the summertime, when the ground was soft, so they could place the winch in the appropriate place.
           </p>
           <p>
            We would set up a line when the weather was cloudy and snowy and hope it wouldn't be snowed in when the light was good enough for shooting," recalls the New Hampshire native. "The ideal conditions for us were fresh, untracked snow and sunshine. Because the weather changed so often, we only got those conditions for three hours during the entire week we were there.

            </strong>
            says that the biggest challenge to getting this shot of 57 skydivers attempting a world record-setting big-way vertical formation was shooting images while holding the center position. In big-way skydiving the center, or base, of the formation is responsible for holding the formation together. If the base doesnt fly well then the rest of the group wont be able to set their formation. Because of this, Nelson opted to shoot with a GoPro Hero3+ set on burst mode. This allowed me to just press the button, not worry about framing, and just focus on flying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nelson and his team attempted the record seven to eight times. By the end of the weekend they had set three world records, three national records, and four state records in Texas.
           </p>
           <p>
            The record-breaking event honored pioneering big-way skydiver Robby Bigley, who died in a skydiving accident in 2009. About a year ago, Robbys wife and friends were going through some of his old documents, and they found the blueprints for the formation that's in my picture, says Nelson. The formation had not yet been achieved until this day. When I see the sun peeking through the formation, it makes me feel like Robby was there with us, and it makes me smile.

            Pompermayer has been shooting big waves for more than a decade. He's seen the sport evolve over that time. It used to be that surfers would only use Jet Skis to get out to the large breaks, but now some courageous surfers have started paddling out for the giant waves.

            , who just made the first ascent of the Process, an intensely difficult problem on a 50-foot boulder in the Buttermilks near Bishop, California. It took two winter seasons, around 15 days, and a year's worth of mental preparation for Woods to complete this prized project that has turned away many other climbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This boulder bakes in the sun all day, which makes it impossible to grasp the minimal holds, so Woods climbed at night. "We ended up having 25 crash pads and resorted to night sessions to get those cold, sticky temps," Woods says. Luckily, a motivated crew of friends came out to help carry pads, arrange them, hold lights, and give encouragement beneath the stars. "Because of all the logistics and mental and physical torture this line brought us, we thought the Process was an appropriate name.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The movement is very committing. The holds are sharp and cut up your fingertips, allowing for only a few tries each day. The height of the boulder made it difficult to feel safe and commit in the no-fall zone at 30 feet. So yeah, there were a lot of factors that made this thing next level."

            Scientists have been studying glacial retreat on Kilimanjaro for decades. As for the ice Gadd climbed, it may already be gone. I'd be very surprised if [the ice] were still there now, says Gadd. The guides said it was radically different every week they were up therea huge glacial system in its death throes really.

            Perfect conditions on the last day of the season at Mount Ruapehu's Turoa ski field made it one of the best days of the year. Here, a snowboarder on the ideal spring snow makes a turn toward Mount Ruapehu's volcanic crater. Located on New Zealand's North Island, Ruapehu is one of the world's most active volcanoes, with its last major eruption occurring in 2007.

           </p>
           <p>
            A raging snowstorm kept them from seeing much, but that was OK with Hoare. There was something richly satisfying about being out in this blizzard," he says. "Bundled up warmly and with a steep ridge behind us as a handrail, I was as happy as a pig in poo as we pushed into the wild weather.

            I love a ski descent. It is an especially rich experience when many hours of boot packing or skinning up are reduced to a few minutes of intense exhilaration on the ride down, he says. Even more so when climbing a Pacific Northwest volcano and on the descent skiing past many others trudging down on footthen it feels like cheating. In Greenland it was a great blend of climbing and skiing. Though the rock in places was often bad enough I was thankful of the solid snow under my boots.

            I love the skiing down the best, but I don't love the skinning up, says 11-year-old Lilliana Libecki, seen here with her dad, Mike, on their recent sailing-skiing expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula in front of Paradise Bay and a colony of Gentoo penguins. It was Lillianas very first expedition with her dad, a National Geographic Adventurer of the Year, Expeditions Council grantee, and veteran of 50-some remote expeditions. I will never ever forget the skiing and icebergs and how curious and unafraid the penguins were, Liliana says. It was so marvelous.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Mike returned from Antarctica in 2008 with photos of skiing and snowboarding on the continent, Lilli, then five years old, was inspired. Lilli loved that I was skiing down to penguins and talked about it continually as she got olderthis dream really stuck with her, Mike recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally when she was old enough, she started training for this goal in the backcountry and worked so hard to make this dream come true, Mike says. It was the best trip of my life, hands down, and my sixth time to Antarctica.

            </strong>
            on El Capitans Muir Wall in Yosemite. Shooting El Cap is unique in that you have so much exposure under your feet. Dickey has photographed Yosemite National Park and El Cap for more than a decade but had never shot this part of the Muir Wall.
           </p>
           <p>
            I ran into Alex prior to his ascent and his intentions sparked my interest. I had several scenarios in mind, none of which could have compared to the actual moment, recalls Dickey. Over four days, Dickey watched the climbers and hiked to rappel in when Honnold approached the crux section near last light on the PreMuir. Trying to get into position or even just find someone can be mind blowing, and getting lost on El Cap is an experience in and of itself. That particular section of the wall gets the very last burst of light in the day, so I had my fingers crossed that the timing would work out to shoot right at that moment. When I rappelled in, Alex was ready to go and the light was even more spectacular than I had hoped, he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here Dickey captured a moment just before the climbers roped fall. When Alex fell off of that last hard move I could hardly believe it; the fall was huge and awkward. Before the fall, the fight he put out to try and stick that move ... was amazing. There were loud yells from the meadow down below, cheering him on.

            . Flanders and his team approached the stunt with due respect for its potentially deadly consequences. We rode a bike off a cliff into a rope jump a few years ago, which proved it was relatively safe to free fall with a bike but didn't tell us what would happen during the deployment of a canopy, recalls Flanders. To mitigate the possibility of calamity, we had our rigger Marty Jones design a cutaway system that would disconnect us from the bike if anything went awry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Landing was a particular challenge and one that they addressed with experience and careful planning. The landings did not work out every time," says Flanders. "It took a while before we figured out the best method for putting [the bike] down. There were a lot of awkward landings coupled with slow-motion topping over. We wore full body armor.
           </p>
           <p>
            While it can be done safely by professionals, bike BASE jumping adds more variables to each jump, and it isn't something I want to make a habit of.

            . I was quite nervous, and adrenaline was pumping through me. Cameras rolled and shutters clicked as the sound of tires on the slick rock suddenly disappeared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Schusler joined Flanders, Matt Blank, and filmmakers from Camp 4 Collective in Moab, Utah, to document the mostly unknown sport of bike BASE jumping. I was actually one of the mountain-bike athletes on the shoot, and Ian was my stunt double for the BASE jumping shots. Im also a photographer, so when Ian geared up to ride off the cliff, I was eager to snap some photos of the event, says Schusler.
           </p>
           <p>
            The shoot and attempt came with careful planning for exact execution. This was by no means a normal BASE jump, and thus the preparation to maximize the chances for success were taken very seriously. It was definitely a team effort. I only had one chance to get the shot I was after, so that definitely added to the intensity of the moment, he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew I wanted to shoot backlit into the sun, as the view in that direction was stunning. You also get a good gauge of the depth of the canyon that Ian was jumping into from the perspective that I chose to shoot from. Setting up the jump took most of the day, so I had plenty of time to experiment with what angle I wanted to shoot from, he recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            After a few short seconds the thundering sound of Ians parachute echoed through the canyon and he sailed down for a graceful landing as we all watched on in disbelief.

            With so many unknown factors, Mancuso did not have specific frames planned out. My only goal photo-wise was to get technical climbing shots on the face and scenic climbing on the ridge. I felt confident that if the conditions were good, there would be potential for spectacular photos, says Mancuso.

            After weeks of breaking trail in difficult terrain, the challenges of the unknown, and an unsuccessful attempt on an adjacent peak, having the summit within reach was an incredible feeling. Once we got onto the ridge, the views were breathtaking and I couldnt believe how beautiful it actually was.

            Its been a few years since this amazing route was first found and bolted by Dario Ventura and then first climbed by Adam Taylor, both local fixtures down in the Red River Gorge of Kentucky," says Boulder-based photographer

            "Since then, a thick grove of ivy has been slowly creeping up the soft sandstone and making its way over the top of the upper half of the wall. Ive been keeping an eye on it, knowing the ivy explodes with color for only a few days before dropping its leaves and baring its naked roots. It took me a few years to time it correctly."
           </p>
           <p>
            A mid-October cold snap sent the foliage into a frenzy and gave Fischhuber just the friction he needed to hold the sloping pinches and shallow pockets while ascending this unique route. The Tube, rated 5.14b, is truly one of the Souths most stunning lines," Mann says.

            Good weather was on their sidethe expedition only saw two days of rain the entire trip. "The light was perfect that day, and the rainbow was coming and going. When Lars dropped in, I saw that the rainbow was there, but also that another one had just appeared on the left, says Heurteau. I quickly checked my camera's LCD screen to see if all this was true, but with the sun I couldnt see clearly. The boys were rushing me to go down and continue the run. This was literally the start of the lower section, and we had a lot more to paddle through. I couldnt wait to get back to the van and put all the shots on the laptop.

            "Falling into one is extremely dangerous, as often the bergschrund extends down to the bedrock, which can mean the hole can extend hundreds of feet deep," notes Townsend, who lives in Squaw Valley, California. "I skied this line because the snow and spines above the bergrschund were too tasty to pass up!"

           </p>
           <p>
            The hills of this part of England are not known for mountainous terrain. On the opposite side of the canyon was this slope down to the river that resembled the kind of big-mountain terrain we're used to riding in British Columbia, and I knew this was going to be a special shot, since no one has seen big-mountain freeriding come out of England before, says Gore.
           </p>
           <p>
            With clouds overhead, Gore waited for the perfect light to take his shot. I was waiting for the right cloud to come and diffuse the light. I wanted to make sure you could see the shadow detail in the hillside, he recalls. When Jelley fired down the mountainside, Gore was ready. Sometimes a rider can carry too much speed through a line like this and tomahawk down. I was definitely afraid of Callum falling here, but the dirt was good, and he stayed in control all the way through. I could see he was carving pretty hard and knew we nailed it.

            Some people talk about big-wave surfing as this tragic, alarming, and death-defying adrenalin injection, but I almost feel the opposite. The ocean is very forgiving, and water makes for a wonderful cushion, says bodysurfer

            , a section of large sea waves breaking over a shallow area. I ultimately feel like a seal playing on and negotiating a rocky outcrop, in swell, if you've ever been lucky enough to witness this majestic phenomenon.

            This bombora just stands up and throws out; you never really know what it's going to do, says photographer

             Ray Collins
            </strong>
            , who's known for both his surfing and wave photography. Bodyboarders are usually after the mutant, ledgy, and thick waves that break on dry reefsthat most stand-up surfers don't want to ride. So I just try and capture fresh angles of what they do, and hopefully that translates into provoking imagery, says Collins.
           </p>
           <p>
            Collins almost always photographs from the water, but this time, he was shooting from land. This is one of those times where land was really the only option, shooting with my long lens from the rocks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brenden is one of the most committed wave riders in the world, so when I shoot with him I'm always a little worried. He will go beyond the limits of what most surfers call rideable for a five-second rush. I shoot the action tight so you can get an abstract view of an interesting human story with the energy of the Pacific Ocean.

After seven years of planning and two failed attempts to reach Arctic wilderness by floatplane, Stookesberry was not disappointed. The Nachvak was even more amazing than we could have hoped for in that it was entirely runnable, he says. It was certainly the first time in my expedition kayaking career that a first descent was made with no portages and at the same time had multiple drops approaching a hundred feet tall.

            MacDonald and her paragliding crew were in Malawi working with the Cloudbase Foundation and Keen footwear to kick off the School of Dreams, a local initiative started by filmmaker Ben Jordan and Malawis only pilot, Godfrey Masauli. The crews mission was to identify paragliding locations in Malawi where tandem flights could be offered to locals and tourists and create a film that would inspire the outside world to support local activities in Malawi.

            MacDonald was flying for an hour before she took this frame. She was also battling an unusual amount of motion sickness. Im a pilot myself and never suffer motion sickness when Im flying solo, but for this shoot I flew tandem, which inevitably makes me very, very ill," she says. "I was vomiting quite violently between camera bursts, which made things challenging. As the sun began to set, I could see the grass on the hillside lighting up and wanted to capture the pilot flying around it."

           <p>
            Unlike other landing sites they had visited, here the team was greeted by hundreds of curious locals, who had never seen paragliding before. It was amazing and very powerful, and at the same time overwhelming and stressful. We often couldnt get enough room to pack up our gliders, so wed have to just throw everything into the trucks and drive off to a more private place.

The route runs across the main entrance to the cave and the sky outside was cloudy. It was like having a giant softbox lighting [the scene] from the leftperfect!

            Gimenez often tries to work without hanging from a rope, which restricts his position. For this image, the ground rises slightly out of the cave, so it was ideal to work without hanging on a rope, he says.

            Gimenez regularly photographs Ondra, who climbs routes so complex that completing them often takes several days, allowing Gimenez to plan for the best photos. This time I had no second chance; I couldn't ask him to stop or to repeat a particular movement, says Gimenez. "Adam was climbing at a level where he felt relatively comfortable, and he rarely fails."

It's a perfect wave, but dangerous, he says. It's very shallow and near a reef break, so any mistake can be fatal.
           </p>

            Medina's performance scored a victory over 11-time Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) World Champion Kelly Slater. Kelly Slater is the best in my sport, and to beat him in the final was a childhood dream, says Medina, who started surfing when he was eight years old. He has always been an example for me, and today I still learn a lot from him. It was certainly one of the best days of my life so far.

            Big waves create big spray. When the waves are this big, they literally spit on you, shooting a cloud of spray though the barrel that feels like a rain shower, says Scholtz. You have to finish shooting the wave and then just as quickly cover your lens before the shower.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scholtz photographs the ASP tour throughout the year and was struck by the perfect conditions at Teaupho'o this year. The elements need to align to create days like this, and it doesnt happen very often. We were just so lucky to have perfect sunshine, hardly any wind, and a massive swell that made for buttery conditions with not a drop of water out of place. It was one of the best days of professional surfing the world has ever seen.

We had scrambled up this pretty loose ridgeline to get at the chutes we were looking to ski and had topped out on a nice high point, where I was standing to shoot this, says Lowe. Between the fleeting sunlight, Lowe captured this dramatic still in the Beartooth Mountains.

Seeing Havasu Creek for the first time immediately enchanted the photographer, but the group continued downriver to set up camp for the evening. As soon as we tied up the rafts, I set off, searching around for a perspective, knowing some of the crew was bound to explore the canyon with paddleboards, says Woodward.

            Schaefer set out with German climber Alexander Megos in Cse, France, a famous climbing destination, to capture a unique look at routes that have been photographed often. Here Megos is seen on Biographie (also known as Realization), one of the most famous sport climbs in the world. When Chris Sharma first climbed this route in 2001 after years of trying, it was considered possibly the hardest route known. In the summer of 2014, Megos ascended the route in four attempts over a single day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neither of us just wants to makes photos for the sake of making photos. If I'm gonna get my camera out, I want to make a great photo and do it right. If Alex is going to go through the effort to work with a photographer, he wants to also do it right, says Schaefer.
           </p>
           <p>
            To get the shot, Schaefer was fixed to an anchor above Megos. Most of the time, Schaefer anchors a second rope to the ground, but in this case he wanted a unique angle, so he tied a rope directly underneath himself, then walked the rope out from the wall a couple hundred feet and anchored it, allowing himself to be 25 feet off the wall to photograph.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd seen many other photos of this particular route and they all looked pretty similar. I wanted to try and do something different and the key to that was getting as far away from the wall as I could. I knew the farther away from the wall I could get the more pronounced the texture and streaks would become.

It took a lot of effort to put the boots back on in the cold after a long ski day and tour 45 minutes out to where we wanted to ski, says Seagel, who lives in Squamish, British Columbia. The duo skied and shot for around three hours. Each attempt to capture the photo took around 40 minutes to set up. Despite the minus 30C cold, it was easy to stay out under the auroraone of the most indelible experiences I've ever had.

            This single photograph of a skier and the aurora was the reason for a trip to these mountains, says photographer

            , who had been thinking about this photo for several years. The Tombstone Mountains lie right underneath the ideal latitude for the aurora, so it offered a great place to try to capture this dream image.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just getting on location was a challenge. When flying into the Tombstones our ski plane almost crashed, so we had to circle back to the airport, forcing us to walk for two days with 150 pounds of gear each. And when we finally got on the mountains, the avalanche conditions were terrifying, says Krabbe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Using long exposures, Krabbe constantly adjusted his lighting as the aurora light fluctuated. With a strobe set up below the skiers mark, Krabbe was ready to trigger the strobe after a 20-second exposure, hoping Seagel would hit his mark while skiing practically blind in the dark.

           <p>
            The pair headed back to base camp at 2:30 a.m. thinking they didn't get the shot. It was only when Krabbe opened the file on his computer that he knew hed captured the image hed been hunting for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel as though the chances of aligning all the factorsthe aurora, clear skies, moonless night, south-facing perspective, aligning light levels when they are always changing, time of night, snow quality, and a skieris like winning the lottery, recalls Krabbe.

           </p>
           <p>
            The Wedge is actually known as a bodysurfing and bodyboarding wave, but on the right days it's very surfable, says Okvist, who says this was the biggest day of 2013 for the break. Usually the bigger it gets, the better it is for surfing.

            The Wedge is one of my favorite surf breaks for its size, ferocity, danger, and the sheer craziness of it all, says photographer
            <strong>
             Benjamin Ginsberg
            </strong>
            . Having photographed the Wedge in the past, Ginsberg knew where to set up to get his shot and stay safe at the dangerous break. I knew my best chance for a dramatic image would be down the beach at an extreme angle, using a long lens.
           </p>
           <p>
            It proved to be the right decision, as I was able to get the shot of a larger, dramatically pitching wave with Bobby very close to shore, and without a crowd of people or a dozen little cameras on extended poles poking back up and out through the wave face."
           </p>
           <p>
            With a gray June gloom forecast for the day, Ginsberg photographed under less than ideal conditions. The low cloud cover made for significant background noise and low light levels. It was exceedingly difficult to set the camera shutter at a speed that would freeze motion without producing grainy images," he says. "Fortunately, when the water was as clear as it was that day, the contrast between the color of the breaking wave and steel gray sky helped create a striking composition."

The approaches in Wendenstock are pretty serious and fairly dangerous, so it took us some time to navigate to the start of the route safely. For a while, I didn't think we'd even be able to go climbing, says Schaefer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Luckily the weather was manageable, and the climbers set out to climb Coelophysis. Thankfully for me, Tommy doesn't climb extremely fast. This gave me a lot of time to try different framing and angles. I had actually been struggling with the clouds most of the day, as they were so thick it was hard to see anything. I knew there was a chance I would get something really unique, but I wasn't getting my hopes up too high. An hour or so after I got this shot, it started to rain and we were all forced to go down, says Schaefer. I was a bit luckyI got some shots in.

            I discovered and fell in love with skiing long before I started to climb. As a kid, I grew up skiing in jeans in Minnesota. Yup  I know  but I lived for it, and I still do, says Chin, who now splits his time between Jackson, Wyoming, and New York City. Jackson is totally incredible for skiing. Between the tram at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Teton Pass, and Grand Teton National Park, there is a lot of skiing to doon piste, backcountry skiing, and ski mountaineering.

At this point we had climbed over ice bulges, bootpacked up steep couloirs, and ascended over 6,250 feet from the valley floor, so we were feeling it for sure, says Bardon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bardon had never skied with Chin before but seized the moment: Jimmy is such an ideal subject to photograph due to his technical mastery in the mountains. The guy is a ninja up there. Swift yet fluid, fast yet safe, and just cracking jokes the whole time. Frankly, I was just trying to keep up!

"Watching the lip land next to you, feeling the wave bend back behind you, seeing the boats in the channel go over the wavebeing in the middle of all that energy is unexplainable," says the Hawaiian surfer, who started riding waves at age two with his father on Oahu's North Shore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rothman wiped out on this wave. "When I fell, I was sliding on my back for what felt like forever. The water felt like concrete when I hit it. Then this giant lip was landing next to my head, and I thought I was going to die. But as soon as it finally sucked me over, it was like a huge giant picked me up and shook me as hard as he could for 40 seconds under water, then let me up.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It wasn't hard for me to get back into surfing big waves after that wipeout," Rothman reflects. "It just makes me really respect these waves and the people that surf them, because these waves could easily kill you."

He didnt seem too phased about his ride, although the wipeout sure was violent. I think the surfers relive their rides differently once they see the view from the channel. I dont think they realize how big the wave is behind them during the actual ride.

            Each day we would climb two to 3,000 feet up any number of lines that surrounded the fjords. There were hundreds to choose from. We'd try and tackle a few a day. Unlike my home mountains in the Cascades, the access was incredibly convenient. Drive and scout your lines, then park and climb, then ski them. Perfect," recalls Hummel. Standing on the ocean with sea weed and seagullsskis still on my feetwas a real pleasure. You can't maximize your skiing any more than that! Snow doesn't go any lower.

            The fog adds another dimensiona mountain in the sky, says photographer Sam Bi of getting this shot of climber Jos Agust on La Joya de la Corona on Montserrat in Catalonia, Spain. Montserrat is an iconic mountain that inspired many Spanish artists, including Gaudits a fantastic world. The main challenge is to observe and see the characteristics of the place.

            This route was actually Bis alternative plan. The weather was too bad to go on a long and high route. And by chance, the fog came in at the right time and disappeared very quickly after, he recalls. The swiftly moving fog became the biggest challenge of the shoot. The fog was stable for one minute, and one second later the fog surrounded us. I crossed my fingers the sun didnt appear because the fog would disappear very, very quickly.

            While it yields great results with the backlight creating that beautiful green glow in the waves, it can pose challenges as the camera struggles to hold its focus, says Scholtz, who shot from Surfer's Point. Shooting from below the wave, rather than from above on the cliff, emphasizes the size of the wave and allows you to capture that beautiful backlight.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the biggest challenges to shooting surfing on the Margaret River is the distance from the beach to the breakalmost half a kilometer out to sea. To make up for the distance, Scholtz works with a long lens, including an extender for her 500mm lens.

            . The climb was assigned by Sports Illustrated, and Buisse knew the photo he wanted to capture. I scouted this route a week prior and kept tabs on ice conditions and temperatures in the few days before the shoot, he recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            Set up on a fixed line, Buisse was able to move up and down on pace with the climbers and shoot the various angles he had in mind. This is the type of image I was really looking to shoot while planning. Everything else was bonus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping the lighting simple, Buisse shot above the second pitch, below and to the side of the climbers. I wanted to keep the lighting relatively simple, as logistics were very complicated, and it was impossible to reposition the flashes once I was up on the wall. For this particular image, I used a single studio strobe ten meters away from the base of the waterfall, equipped with a zoom reflector to focus the beam on the single area where the climber would be. I was careful to balance the power of the flash with the headlamps of the climbers, says Buisse.

            . I have skied Superior nearly a hundred times, and this day would be in the top three for snow conditions. It was deep, light, and stable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I contacted a few of my most trusted backcountry skiers for a Superior shoot, including Caroline. She is a seasoned pro with heavy avalanche safety credentials. I knew I could count on her to make the right decisions, Wissman says, adding that this was of particular importance due to the treacherous conditions of the 2014 season.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the two veterans worked their way down the mountain, a phenomenon revealed itself. When it's cold with bluebird skies in the Wasatch, its a fairly typical phenomenon to see something I call the sparkle effect. If you get the angle just right, you can capture it. Shooting from the ridge of Superior, where he could capture the line Gleich choose, Wissman knew he had a dramatic angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sun was in the perfect location to make the sparkles come to life," recalls Wissman. "The eastern flank of Superior was lit up while the base area of Snowbird was still shaded, giving the photo depth and contrast. I spent a total of 40 minutes navigating through deep snow and pepper rock in order to find my angle. As Caroline slid into my frame, I knew instantly we had nailed it.

It's considered the proving grounds for big-wave surfing."The cliff at Pauwela Lighthouse and the West Maui Mountains rise in the distance.

            Soledade has a lot of experience in big waves: He first surfed Peahi in 1999 and first paddled into the powerful break in 2004. "There is a lot of training and preparation before every season and session, but the goal is to push the limits but be safe at the same time," he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            On this day, the weather was perfect. "Usually there is always wind and cloud cover," Soledade recalls. "But on this day we had no wind and not even one single cloud in the sky."

            Jaws is a such a raw place and the waves can get massive. Its dangerous, even for those who are shooting or watching on the channel. You cannot mess around there, says photographer Fred Pompermayer. Familiar with shooting at the turbulent break, Pompermayer decided to go outside of the safety channel to photograph.
           </p>
           <p>
            On this particular day, everything was perfect. I decided to try to get a different angle. I set myself up on the left side of the channel with the Jet Ski to capture the unique angle, getting close to the impact zone and framing the cliff in the background, he recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I saw Yuri Soledade paddling for that wave, I knew I was in a good spot for an incredible photo," Pompermayer says. "I love the composition of this photo. Its the perfect big wave, with the surfer going right, and the Peahi cliff showing in the background.

            on the Excommunication route of the Priest, a freestanding tower in Castle Valley, Utah. Watt had climbed in the area previously and was psyched to return to photograph for work. The most surprising part of the climb is how short the route really is. Its technically rated one of the hardest towers in the country and is wicked imposing from the base. But in reality its only three pitches of hard climbing with a short, moderate pitch to the summit, recalls Watt.

            To get the shot, Watt tied himself into an anchor about 20 feet above Sorkin and rappelled off the top of the route where it leaves the arte and moves right into a crack. We bivied on the ledge below Castleton that night in horrendous wind, but this shoot went really smooth thanks to the hard work and camaraderie of the crew.

            , seen here running Spirit Falls on the Little White Salmon River. So one final time before the falls, I made sure to clear my face of any accumulated snow. Paddling class V rivers in sub-freezing temperatures is never very comfortable, but as soon as my hands become numb the cold doesn't bother me as much.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Washington State native wore two full-body fleece suits to stay extra warm, and an Immersion Research dry suit to keep dry. Having first run this waterfall when he was 14, Wells has now descended its roiling class V rapids about a hundred times. Paddling these waterfalls is risky and avoiding injuries is always on my mind, says Wells, who now lives in White Salmon, Washington. But I think that becoming comfortable on a variety of different smaller waterfalls has been the best way to stay safe on the bigger and more challenging drops.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spirit Falls is my favorite backyard waterfall, he says. For a solid class V paddler, Spirit is just about an hour's paddle from an easily accessible bridge, but spectators must scurry down a poison oak infested scree field to access the falls.

           </p>
           <p>
            Generally you feel as if you are paddling through a green tunnel among the lush forest. That day, temperatures dropped and eight inches of fresh snow fell along the banks of the river," he says. "We put on the water and I was immediately overwhelmed by the beauty of the winter wonderland."
           </p>
           <p>
            As the team headed down the river, Parker kept in mind not only his framing, but his gear, too. The cloud cover was very thick this day, the light was soft, and it was incredibly wet. I knew that I had to be very careful with my exposure and my equipment. My lens cloth was already drenched at this point in the day, and I resorted to using a backup cotton t-shirt that I keep in my dry bag to clean my lens," he says. "Thankfully, I was able to dry the lens off in time and set my exposure as Todd paddled into the waterfall. And, in the back of my mind, there was some nervousness knowing that I was going to pack my camera up and run the falls next!

             Justin Ridgely
            </strong>
            , owner of the Volcanic Climbing Gym in Honolulu, Hawaii. It's a short scramble through the jungle up a pig trail. The boulder is about 14 feet tall, and the problem [the path that a climber takes] is called All Boars Go to Heaven. This spot, which is known as Boarlomana, is canopied by a large banyan tree and surrounded by bamboo. We shot this in the afternoon  the jungle is thicker there, which gives it that eerie light, Ridgely says.
           </p>
           <p>
            I spend a lot of time climbing and exploring Oahu and the outer islands, he says. I've spent the past four years here developing the bouldering with the rest of the local climbing community. We've gone from two areas to about 44 in that time. The bouldering scene here is amazing, and the aloha spirit is very present in the climbing community.

           </p>
           <p>
            There was a tree next to the boulder, and I was trying to get some new perspectives and angles, Moss says. I climbed the tree, but as I was doing so, realized I was walking through six major ants nests as I was climbing up the branches. The actual spot where I shot this photo from had the biggest ant nest of the six.
           </p>
           <p>
            The boulder is situated in a dark location in the bamboo forest, so Moss added light to make sure his fight with the ants was worth it. I used an on-board flash in order to help with the lighting. All the other photos I shot that day turned out pretty average because of all the light being filtered through the forest. I was happy that this one turned out.

The area above was littered with sharky rocks and sugary snow, which made it less conducive to skiing fluidly into the air. Fortunately, the area had received nearly daily snowfall for a month. I volunteered to go first, Hammer recalls. I went in with more speed than I needed and passed the ideal transition spot, but the snow was soft and the landing gentle."

           </p>
           <p>
            To get the shot, Goodrich positioned himself in a relatively easy-to-access spot. I chose that area because it allowed me to capture the whole face and illustrate how immense it truly is, he recalls. Photographing under the first sunny sky in almost a month, Goodrich adjusted for the shadows cast on the line. I needed an exposure that would allow me to get detail in both the shadows and the highlights once I got the image into Adobes Lightroom, says Goodrich. I knew from experience that as soon as Hadley left the takeoff she was headed into the shade, so capturing shadows that werent black was very important. I was lucky in that snow reflects so much sunlight reflecting into the shadows, which helped my exposure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hadley is a very accomplished skier, so I wasnt surprised at all that she was going for it. Her speed and lack of any hesitation at which she skied the lineits not everyday that you see someone step up to something that big and treat it like they own it, Goodrich says.

            The moment that I savor most in kayaking in extreme places is the one that is captured here.

            Stookesberry set up the framing for the photo and ran a one-second time-lapse while positioning himself at the base of the falls to support Korbulic in case anything went wrong. Pedro and I followed Chris into this maelstrom soon after the camera captured this photo," he recalls. "Then the scariest hour of our 12 days on the Mekong began as we paddled eight kilometers to the nearest village of Hang Khon, Laos.

            The trio battled fishing lines strewn throughout the river that often harm native local wildlife. The river here is infested with countless fishing lines and nets that could have easily ensnared and drowned us that night. Luckily, we made it through this gauntlet, but the freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin has not been so lucky, says Stookesberry.

            All the mist would instantly turn to ice on you, your camera gear, and the ropes, recalls photographer Christian Pondella. Pondella has photographed many times with Gadd at Helmcken Falls, but this time the conditions were harsh. With temperatures dipping below minus 30C at night and only rising to minus 20 during the day, the duo faced extreme cold. Working in those temperatures was incredibly challenging; just to stay warm, you had to constantly be moving, says Pondella.

            Familiar with the location and route, Pondella knew the shot he wanted, where the route finishes right next to the waterfall. I knew that the shot was going to be looking down on Will, with a wide-angle lens showing the immense power of the waterfall and the big void below. To get his photo, Pondella rappelled in from the top of the cave about 15 meters. "It put me into the perfect spot to really capture the enormity of the waterfall and location. It also had me hanging pretty far from the edge of the wall because of how overhung the route was. A seasoned and top industry photographer, even Pondella couldnt avoid battling the elements while hanging in position. Dangling from his rope, Pondella thought to himself, Please dont spin in circles! "Plus, I constantly had to keeping wiping the mist off my lens and the eyepiece of my camera so I could get a clean shot.

"I got a call from Jeremy asking if I had any interest in a trip to Nepal because a spot might open up. A few days later, he called back to see if I was still serious about going. And a few days after that, he called to tell me the spot was mine if I wanted it. I said 'yes.' "

"I setup two still cameras for two different options to make sure I nailed the shot and had photos to choose fromwe knew this trip would be one, maybe two lines ridden total," recalls Miller. "I was shooting from a barbie angle, adjacent to the spine wall. We had to scramble up a rock face to the toe of the glacier, put our crampons on, and rope up for a three-hour walk across a broken glacier to set up our angle at 18,500 feet."

This made the final descent pretty tough, and you can see the in the photo that Jeremy is just barely off belay, snowboarding with an ice axe in hand," says Miller.

           <p>
            Ortiz dropped this 30-foot fall, then had a few seconds to figure out where he was before the next 50-foot drop. "It's of huge importance to be there with someone you trust 100 percent," Ortiz says, and in this case he was with his brother,
            <strong>
             Isidro

            , both from Mexico. "This is a special place to kayak because of the adventure it takes, the fact you are in the core of Zapatistan lands, the difficulty and character of the drops and, of course, the turquoise color of the water," Ortiz says.

           <p>
            With a local friend and guide, Polar scouted Cliffbase, a climbing center on the island of Hvar, before the climb. I knew sunset was the best time to shoot this location, so I scouted and saw that the profile of this particular route would be the best to capture the shape of Koris body against the ocean, and in such a stunning environment, recalls Polar.When Kori was shaking her arm out, I knew it would define her body and give more energy to the photo, so I was really excited that she took a break for those couple of seconds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Polar captured her photo just in time. Right after I got the shot, the route started to move behind the corner and I lost sight of the climber. So I was really glad that up until that point I could see her profile perfectly.

            It's always a challenge to wake up and climb in the dark, but the glow of sunrise makes it all worthwhile. These are the moments I live for, says Utah-based, big-mountain skier

            <strong>
             Nate Smith
            </strong>
            , had bootpacked up the couloir to gain the ridge, then skied down Suicide Chute. The snow inside the chute was surprisingly smooth, chalky, and carveable, recalls Gleich, who is building up her ski mountaineering skills. The wind tends to buff out the snow within the line, keeping it in good shape, while the rest of the south face of Superior was the texture of frozen coral reef.
           </p>
           <p>
            I love the quiet stillnessit's one of the few times in the day I find true mindfulness, says the skier, who has been seen ripping on the cover of every ski magazine, including
            <em>
             Powder
            </em>
            . "Of course, I find the same Zen focus and mindfulness on the way down, but there's something special about the way up. It's slower and allows you to concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other, especially on an exposed ridge line like this one.

            . After a slow winter in Utah, Beyer headed out with Gleich and Smith to cut fresh tracks and capture this photo. I had this shot in mind, and that's why we woke up at 4 a.m. to go out on a little adventure," he says. It hadnt snowed in the last two weeks, so we were just out looking for some decent snow to ski."
           </p>
           <p>
            With a brilliant sunrise chasing them, Beyer shot all day, but knew this was his image of the session. This was the height of the sunrise, and so I had a feeling this would be one of the best photos.

            "This was one of those lines that just happened without a reason. The boys thought that it was good idea to hit that couloir. A few minutes after, I was shooting it. The next step was to shoot from a heli, where Repo captured this photograph.
           </p>
           <p>
            My first thought was, Really? But knowing Xavier, I was comfortable to watch him through my camera, recalls Repo. The terrain was Repos biggest challenge, and he managed balancing the lines exposure, which was variable due to seracs overhanging the couloir. It is hard to fight against Mother Nature, and you know you will lose that battle if you are not careful.

            in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta. "I actually wasn't aware of the ephemeral nature of the Fearful Symmetry route until we arrived in Canmore. Everyone spoke of it with a sort of reverence," says Woodward.
           </p>
           <p>
            The group tackled a rough drive in Ghost Valley to make it to an area called Recital Hall, where this rare, icy route had formed. I understood immediately why the route commands such respect," Woodward recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            The team faced a tough climb in, and Woodward fought snow devils coating his gear in fine, frozen snowy dust. The added challenge of managing gear in inhospitable elements is part of what makes ice climbing such a niche sport, says Woodward.
           </p>
           <p>
            After his initial awe, Woodward was ready to photograph. Once the actual climbing began, I brought all my focus to bear, trying to capture Graham's experience in a single image that would tap into the emotions he experiences as a climber on a pitch like this, says Woodward.

           </p>
           <p>
            We initially went out because it was the 40th anniversary of the first ascent in 1968 by the legendary John Ewbank and thought it would be fun to repeat his aid route, recalls Rollins. It is an amazing piece of rock, and the climbing is of a high quality and quite committing in nature. No one had free climbed the Totem Pole by this route beforewhen we realized we could do it, despite our injuries, it gave us even more motivation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pair spent 15 days working on the route over several months. Just getting to the spire involved a hilly, two-hour hike and nearly 200-foot rappel to the base of the spire. Once there, the Southern Ocean dished out some pretty challenging weather.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the reasons it took us so long was that conditions were often not ideal. Some days were very, very windy. And on others the rock was damp and seeping, so we wouldn't make much progress, recall Rollins. And if the swell is up and you're close to the water level, every now and then a wave will smack you.

            s life since 1994. Ive spent more than 20 days photographing climbers on the Totem Pole. I was keen to photograph Doug and Dean because their ascent of the original Ewbank Route was the first really new thing to be achieved on the Totem Pole in many years, says Carter.
           </p>
           <p>
            To get his shot, Carter rappelled 30 meters from the cliff opposite the climbers. I had in mind to try some different compositions and came up with this, he recalls. In addition to standard climbing gear, Carter uses a chest harness. I can lean right out on the rappel rope and still hold the camera steady.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Totem Pole offers an ideal location for incredible images, photographers battle lighting in the area. It still surprises me how small the window of light is on the Totem Pole," says Carter. "No sooner than the shadow from the Candlestick is gone, then the shadow from the mainland (see on the right) starts to creep across the Totem Pole. Climbers can only move so fast, and there can easily be delays, so it always feels like a bit of luck when it all comes together."

            Chin had photographed Honnold climbing in Yosemite for a previous assignment for

             National Geographic
            </em>
            , but this story was on a much tighter time line. I had a lot more time to shoot the Yosemite story, and I was also much more familiar with the area," Chin recalls. "I had less than three weeks to shoot the Oman story, which isn't a lot of time to shoot a feature story, especially when I'm going to a completely new and remote area. It's great to shoot a place you know well, but I also love the challenge of showing up to a place I've never been and diving straight in."
           </p>
           <p>
            To get this photo of Honnold, Chin positioned himself on a ledge to the side of where Honnald was climbing. I knew the light was amazing and that I better nail the shot. I wasn't sure if Alex was going to be able to get out to the same point again, he says. I had imagined a shot like this, but got really lucky to get the perfect light and cool body position. Alex contorted and strained every muscle in his body to keep himself on the route.

            Things at Jaws happen so fast, I wasn't sure it was even Kai taking off on the wave until my Skidoo driver pointed and said, Kai Lenny,  recalls surf photographer
            <strong>
             Richard Hallman
            </strong>
            . I focused my attention on the wave because I knew he was riding stand-up and even though the wave was small for Jaws, it was big for stand-up. He had a spectacular air drop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lenny dropped into the wave, and Hallman continued to photograph the 20-foot ride until Lenny fell. I knew right away with the few last frames in my camera that it was a particularly bad fall. My biggest concern at this point was his safety.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rescue Jet Skis rushed to help when Lenny resurfaced, and Hallman noticed Lennys foot was bleeding. I immediately took a photo with my 70-200mm zoom camerathe zoom allowed me to see the severity of the cut. My experience as a former trauma nurse told me that this was a particularly bad cut, he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing about big waves is routine. I think that is the why big-waving surfing is such a draw for me," Hallman continues. "It is daunting and challenging as a surfer and as a photographer. It truly is otherworldly to be pressed against the edge of so much energy and to watch these modern-day gladiators drop down these mountains of water.

            of his second ascent of Superfortress, a very difficult mixed ice and rock climbing route near Vail, Colorado. "Yet when the partially formed icicle of the Fang collapsed beneath my feet, the whoosh of air and the corresponding cacophony of about ten tons of icicle shattering a hundred feet below instantly snapped my mind back to the situation beyond the climb." Worried about the people below, Mayo recalls yelling, "Are you OK?" There was no immediate response so he yelled again. "My girlfriend yelled up that she and everyone else were okay. I realized afterward that because the amphitheater overhangs by about 50 feet, the ice had fallen well out and downhill from where they all were belaying and watching.
           </p>
           <p>
            "One of the other routes I have established in Vail I named as a tribute to my late Great-Uncle Tom, who was a copilot of a Flying Fortress, the nickname for the B-17, with the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II. He was shot down in occupied France and survived," says Mayo. "The double entendre is that the amphitheater seems fortress-like and the widely spaced bolts provide opportunity for flying-like falls. Superfortress, which is the nickname for the B-29, seemed like a logical next route as it crossed my first route. I named it before the Fang collapsed, yet it seems very appropriate considering that the amount of ice that fell like a bomb likely weighed about as much as the plane's bomb load capacity."

            . I guess it's the classic case of when to put the camera away. Will had just pulled through the final ice section, and I could only see his feet. I started packing away my camera and preparing to rappel down when I heard a deep crack. Everything was in slow motion as I watched the entire pillar come downit was like something out of a movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dramatic end to Mayos climb on the Fang occurred after Serbo photographed Mayo climbing the difficult route. This climb is way above my climbing limits. On Will's 'warm up' lap he trailed a static line, which he fixed at the top anchor for me, recalls Serbo. I wanted to be close enough to Will at the routes crux while still giving a sense of place. It is a pretty aesthetic amphitheater.

            Gribbon faced tough weather conditionsfor both snowboarding and photographing. Toward the end of the session, Gribbon captured this image. At the end of the season, the sun is pretty high in the sky, which makes for less dramatic photos. It is a balance trying to find decent snow with a feature that is ridable this time of year, he says. The ice and shade kept the surrounding snow rideable at such a late hour in the day.

            on Hallucinogen Wall in Colorado's Black Canyon. I've been shooting on big walls for over a decade and when I first stepped over the edge, it took me a minute to get my head right before continuing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew the Black had some pretty difficult lighting, so I went prepared with gradient filters and a strobe. Once I rappelled in and saw the lighting situation, I put away the filters and milked the contrast for all I could. I toyed with balancing the light using filters and in the end stuck with the high contrast, he recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            In order to get the shots he wanted of Wharton, Dickey started climbing at 4 a.m. His goal was to get a head start on Wharton and then begin the long rappel at around 6:45 a.m. to intersect on the wall a few hundred feet off the ground. Dickey had his lighting and climbing thoroughly planned, but serious routes can give pause even to the most prepared. The biggest challenge of the day was at the startthose first minutes stepping over the edge of the wall. Whenever I get intimidated like that I focus on the task at hand: Check the harness, make sure the carabiner on my belay device is locked, double check camera batteries, and move on.

The two work together often, mostly on skiing shoots. Biking is so much easier to shoot than skiing. You don't have to worry constantly about avalanches, and that is pretty awesome. The temps are nice too!

            This volcanic rock may look beautiful, but it's terrible, unconsolidated, loose, and scary to climb on, says Magro, who lives in Bozeman and has been ice climbing for 15 years. Its one of the reasons why this route is so demanding.

            Ice climbing is one of the most wild mediums of climbing that can be done, says Magro. It has a high level of adventure due to its unpredictability and it's dynamic nature.

            , seen here rushing back to the truck, with his friend Mike in the distance, after a winter surf session 30 minutes outside of town. "The conditions are fickle. Weeks can go by without waves. It's rare that the number of guys in the water exceeds single digitsand we know each other."
           </p>
           <p>
            Curtis and his friends were navigating large, broken up pieces of ice formed by packed snow on the shore that gets soaked, refrozen, and then broken by the waves and tide. "They are a bit tricky, but it is faster to go along on top of them than to slog and weave through the heavy snow in between," Curtis recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gearing up to surf in Alaska's biting cold is critical. "You can still feel the cold through the wetsuit, but luckily it's warmer in the water than on the beach. I'm wearing a 6/5/4 wetsuit, with 7mm booties and mitts. I'm also wearing a thermal rashguard and neoprene trunks," Curtis says. "Some guys use battery-powered, heated tops, but I don't have one. And a couple of the guys I surf with put vaseline on their faces to block the wind on the really cold windy days  I might try that sometime."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hunting for breaks is a big part of the fun," Curtis says. "Even finding a new sand bar a few hundred yards from a known spot, or a spot suddenly working at a different tide than what worked last seasonthat's a thrill."

            . There was no practical way that I could have photographed from the water given the conditions. The current was going much faster than I could swim, and there were large chunks of ice floating through the surf that would have been even more dangerous to me, considering my lack of mobility swimming with the camera.
           </p>
           <p>
            The surfers drove along the Alaskan coast, looking for waves that could be surfed at Cook Inlet. While watching his friends attempt to surf, Dickerson fought the extreme weather on the beach. The beach was a sloped sheet of ice that made it incredibly difficult to get out of the water because it required you to scramble uphill over wet ice between the surging waves, recalls Dickerson. I had to be careful to keep the camera lens protected, while also having to run through thigh-deep snow to keep up with Mike and Gart as they drifted down the beach in the strong current.

            At the time it was very questionable to climb this ice rock because of the danger that it would break and crashalong with the climber, says photographer and climber

            (pictured) told Lugger about the location in Zirknitzgrotte, Austria, the two went to scout and climb. Lugger immediately knew he wanted to light the scene with strobes. When we came there, I knew I wanted make some shots with flashes. Although it's dangerous because of falling ice, the area is very nice for lighting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lugger set up the photo he wanted to capture. I have no standard lighting because every scene needs to be adjusted differently, he says. I imagined this frame when I planned my setup and lights. I had three main angles in mind and two of them worked out for me."

           <p>
            For this shot, Lugger lit the scene with a Hensel Studio strobe and blue gel. He also used another strobe to brighten the climber. The biggest challenge during the shoot was to not get hit by falling ice, and not to slip on the ice with my Hasselblad in my hands.

            of this moment on the steepest known kayakable whitewater sequence in the world, found in Chiapas, Mexico. "I was feeling totally stoked and high-energy when dropping the last 50 feet." This section of the river, which carves a path near the Guatemala border, tumbles over the rocks at an average slope of 1,900 feet per mile.
           </p>

"Just for Angel Wings, the first and most savage drop, you have to count 100 percent on your team if anything goes wrong."
           </p>
           <p>
            "I've been to this river every year since kayaker Ben Stookesberry showed it to me six years ago," recalls Ortiz. "And I've always dreamed about doing every single one of the drops in one day. It's the ultimate thrill. You can paddle every single one of the drops in less than three minutesit's insane!"

Semenuk, who lives in the mountain biking hub of Squamish, British Columbia, would drop about 30 feet to land near the tire track seen at the bottom left of the photo.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Rampage is one of the craziest mountain bike contests out there," Semenuk, a third-time competitor, says. "The fact that you get to build whatever you'd like to ride is what makes it interesting to me."

            is familiar with creating unique photos at the crowded event. Each year the main challenge is finding out which riders are hitting what lines and jumps so you can get yourself in the right position for their runs, says Pondella. I always try to do something unique and different than what other photographers are shooting. A big part of the fun is running around the hills with all these great photographers.
           </p>
           <p>
            To get this angle, Pondella attached his camera to a 15-foot pole and held it above the canyon to reveal the chasm Semenuk jumped into. I felt this perspective would bring you right into Brandon's world, a place very few people want to be. It shows where he is coming from and where he is going, as well as how precise he has to be to stick that landing. If his trajectory or speed is slightly off, he will either smack the wall or land in the flats, both being a horrific crash he would not likely walk away from.

            of this moment launching off a 45-foot cliff at dusk in Brighton Ski Resort, Utah. This was the first time Longe had skied off this particular cliff, but he had hucked others in the area. Brighton has a wide variety of cliff bands that are easy to access and see relatively low traffic compared with most ski resorts. Fresh, cold Utah powder would make his landing softif only he could see it.

            "I couldn't see the landing, but it was not too worrisome actuallyI was able to visualize the whole thing and was quite confident I could make it," says Longe, who lives in Salt Lake City and has been skiing for 26 years.

            </strong>
            headed to Brighton with the intention of capturing this exact shot. I was looking for a big cliff to shoot at dusk, and this one at Brighton is great to shoot and easily accessible.
           </p>
           <p>
            To get his shot, Markewitz trekked up and down from the cliff multiple times to calibrate his photo and get the frame just right. The biggest technical challenge was setting up the strobes and calibrating everything before it got too dark to get the evening sky, he says. With one strobe positioned at the top of the cliff and another stand holding two strobes at the base of the jump, the photographer was ready. We got this shot in one take, Markewitz recalls.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was pretty ballsy for Dash to jump off a cliff that big when he could barely see the landing and then get blasted with the strobes, which basically blinded him before he landed, the photographer adds.

            Markewitz photographed with a Nikon D3, a 17-35mm lens, two Broncolor Mobil2 power packs set up with three heads on stands, and pocket Wizard radio transmitters to fire everything.

            Olson is seen during a difficult section on a route called Neolithic. This is a big move, and when you release the lower tool, your body responds by swinging past horizontal to compensate. Controlling the swing is the crux of the route, says Olson, who lives in Canmore, Alberta, and works as a mountain guide and climbs competitively. On this route, you have all your weight on your arms for long periods of time, so the clock is ticking. You need to keep moving to keep holding on.

            . When Bride arrived at the cave he found himself battling harsh shadows, wet conditions, and fluctuating temperatures. The difference in temperature within the mouth of the cave and ten feet outside was incredible. My camera kept fogging up and I was getting soaked from the dripping water.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Bride explored the cave to find the images he wanted to shoot, he saw this frame. Looking back, I remember thinking how cool the composition looked through my viewfinder. I felt like it could be a special image.
           </p>
           <p>
            When sun began to burn off the morning clouds, Bride knew he needed to get his shot before shadows overtook the scene. By hiding the forest behind the stalagmites, taking a reading from the natural light on the wall behind Jen, and a second reading from the ice stalagmites, I was able to create a balanced look throughout the image.

            For me this was one of those moments that you hope for as a photographer, says Woodward. Fortunately, he had the opportunity to get the shot hed been planning for. I watched as Blake and Scott became specks, framed by the steep converging lines of the gorge and the river below. Working in unison their smallness echoed my own feelings of awe for the majesty of the gorge, and in the moment I snapped the shot it felt right.

            of getting in the barrel of the popular Monument wave break located along the Great Australian Bight in South Australia. This wave is a very dangerous, heaving barrel very close to the cliff and on an extremely shallow reef. I was extremely focused at coming out of the other end! This unique wave should only be surfed by expert surfers. I have spent a lot of time here, and it is not for the faint-hearted when the wave starts to get some size, say Atkinson, whose main goal is to qualify for the ASP World Tour.

            "There almost isn't a day that goes by over here when you don't get to share a few waves with a seal or a pod of dolphins, says the 19-year-old Aussie who lives in Adelaide and has been surfing for a decade. I love it when they are aroundespecially when the dolphins surf the waves with you and jump all around you.

            And, in Australia, marine life is followed by its apex predatorsharks. The region is known for sharks, and there have been a few fatal attacks in the area in the past 10 to 15 years. But I always tell myself I have more to worry about on the drive over than a shark in the water bothering me, says Atkinson.

            . This coastline is famous because of the great white shark documentaries filmed here. This day the swell was as big as the wave can handle and was beyond the skill of average surfers, but these are the conditions that pro surfers, like Dion, crave."
           </p>
           <p>
            To get a photo that captured the wave, surfer, and coastline, Shield went wide. I chose to shoot this session with a 10.5mm fish-eye lens to try to get inside the barrel with Dion and also to include all of the rock formation, he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was feeling good and fairly confident of having shot some decent images when a huge seal popped up next to me. After getting over my initial shock, I felt relief that the huge grey shape was not a shark! This was short lived, as the seal started swimming at me and barking at me! recalls a surprised Shield.

            on paddling these rapids, known as the Hole That Ate Chicago, in the Grand Canyon of the Stikine River in British Columbia, Canada. Serrasolses did a total of four runs down the canyon and claimed the second descent of the Site Zed rapids, becoming the second person to run all the rapids on the legendary river. The Stikine is considered the Everest of kayaking and is one of the best big-water runs in the world, says Serrasolses. It offers a three-day trip down one of the most beautiful canyons you can imagine, through wild and untouched nature, with the best rapids you can think of. It's a paradise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most important of all though, I had a great time with all my friends and discovered one of my favorite runs of all time! Serrasolses was joined by other members of the Adidas SickLine Team.

            I knew that if Gerd swam, he wouldn't be able to get out before V Drive, another of the crux rapids on the Stikine, and only a hundred meters downstream, recalls professional kayaker and photographer
            <strong>
             Barny Young
            </strong>
            . Shooting from a small rocky outcrop along the river, Young was able to get close to the rapids and paddler thanks to a keen understanding of how kayakers navigate rivers such as this.I anticipated having Gerd in the foreground of the photo punching this huge hydraulic at its weakest point. Instead, he was thrown off-line by a large lateral upstream and dropped into the meat of the hole, backwards, says Young.
           </p>
           <p>
            From a photographic perspective, this frame is great, as the size of Gerd in comparison to the hole gives justice to how big it actually is," says Young. Towering rock walls line the Stikine, drowning out most sunlight before it reaches the canyons rushing river. Often, the lack of sun can be an issue due to the sheer-walled nature of the river. Normally in this situation I would lower my shutter speed to let in more light. On the Stikine, however, the river and subject are moving so fast that this could lead to motion blur, so I find myself lifting my ISO to account for this, he says.

            "With so much snow at the start of the 2013 Southern Hemisphere winter, our mission was to find an unusual place to go snowboarding and make the most out of the amazing snowfall," says Brown of this trip with photographer Tim Pierce. "We achieved more than we set out to do." Brown spends his winters in New Zealand's top skitown, Wanaka, then chases snow around the globe.

           </p>
           <p>
            Working with snowboarder Brown, Pierce took advantage of the morning light. It was quite challenging getting into position to shoot this, hiking in deep snow, up slippery clay cliffs, with a lot of camera kit. The duo targeted a curvaceous gully. "It had a lot of amazing shapes and forms and a good line for Mitch to snowboard," recalls Pierce."We found a little roller that Mitch could pop off, and he completed the image with a stylish tweaked tailgrab.

            "It was a game of waiting for the right light and the clouds todisappear. After a few hours in this zone, the clouds parted, light popped, and there was not a breath of wind, which resulted in the lake mirroring its surroundings. It was surreal!

           <p>
            Though the landscape is alluringly beautiful, the skiers were fighting injuries and tough conditions. The biggest challenge we had shooting in Alaska was athletes getting hurt. Early this day Cody Townsend injured his knee, ending his trip and season. The next day Richard was caught in an avalanchepretty damn terrifying toowhich ended his trip and season. The conditions where absolutely perfect for the skiers to really push the limits this year, but anytime they are pushing it that far there is always a risk of injury, says Gunderson.

            On heli-ski shoots, Gunderson always carries two Canon 1DX camera bodies, and an assortment of Canon L lenses, everything from 8mm to 400mm. I tend to ski with a very heavy pack as I always want to make sure I have the best tools to capture the moment, he says.

            of this record-setting flight over Idaho's imposing Big Lost Range. "Imagine flying over some of the largest terrain in the American Westat between 9,000 and 18,000 feetunderneath a piece of highly engineered plastic and some impossibly skinny lines. It was surreal."
           </p>
           <p>
            McClurg flew from Sun Valley, Idaho, for 240 miles, breaking the previous North American Foot Launch record of 204 miles. "The conditions that day were the strongest I'd ever flown in," says McClurg, who lives in Sun Valley and has been been paragliding in Africa, the Himalaya, Europe, and over the Pacific. "When I was low, it was frightening, extremely stressful, and, of course, dangerous; but when I was high, it felt like the world was in my hands."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sun Valley is one of the best spots in the world for paragliding because of the huge mountain ranges, a vast desert to the south, very strong thermals, and long summer days," says McClurg. "We have only just touched the surface. Much larger flights will be done from here in the years ahead, I am sure."

            often finds herself soaring in the clouds taking photographs from a paraglider, such as this shot of McClurg. It makes it easier to be flying with the other pilots because then you are in the same air as them and know where they can and can't fly depending on the conditions. You end up working together, says MacDonald.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really know the specific photos I want to capture until I'm up there and see the geography of the landscape and what the light is doing, says MacDonald. The flying in this part of North America is unique in that it has a combination of huge mountain ranges, strong conditions, and remoteness which makes the exposure very high and the flying very committing.

            The Ruth Gorge is an incredibly scenic place with tons of climbing history and iconic peaksMooses Tooth, Bears Tooth, Dickey, Huntington, and moreall packed into one tight area. It is also very easy to get to," says McLean when recalling the ten-day exploratory trip. "In terms of ski mountaineering, it is kind of all or nothingeither flat or vertical, which makes it a tough place to ski. Still, in the right conditions, there are some amazing lines in that area. McLean moved to Park City, Utah, 25 years ago. He has made steep, remote first ski descents on all seven continents.

            Anticipating the challenge of working in such frigid conditions, Grove gathered tips from longtime ski photographers Jordan Manley and Christian Pondella before the expedition. The two essential tips were: Keep your camera bodies and lenses outside in the cold but sleep with all and any batteries," says Grove. "Every night my camera and lenses would just sit out there, and I would nestle in with about five to six batteries, a hot Nalgene of water, and my ski-boot liners.

            Shooting from the water is my preferred perspective because there is a much greater chance of capturing something unusual and unexpected than when shooting from the beach or from a boat, recalls photographer

            , who had arrived with longtime friend Fanning in Tahiti two weeks before the surfing world tour competition in 2009 to test the waves at the famed Teahupo'o surf break. There is a much higher risk you may not be in the optimum position for the best wave of the day or might miss the best action altogether, but I firmly believe that low risk equals low reward.
           </p>
           <p>
            To capture this unusual composition, Frank had a bit of luck and great placement in the water. There is a very tight window of opportunity with a picture like this; everything is moving so quickly. There is certainly some luck involved. It makes up for the other one hundred times that I have just missed out on the peak moment because my timing was off by a tenth of a second, says Frank.

           </p>
           <p>
            In order to get this shot while helping Stookesberry set up at the waterfall's lip, Korbulic used a remote camera. I needed to be over at the lip with Ben to help secure his entry into the water, but I didn't want to give up this shot,"says Korbulic."So I left the camera on a tripod, tied it to some slick roots hanging over the falls, and brought my remote shutter release and another camera out to the lip."
           </p>
           <p>
            The region had been hit by heavy rainfall, and the brown water thrashing below the falls prevented the kayakers from knowing what what was beneath the water's surface. As Ben went over the lip the front of his boat caught a rock edge, stalled his forward momentum, and sent him barreling upside down into a pretty awful looking cauldron, recalls Korbulic. After Ben came out safely, I was almost just as worried that my camera didn't fire as I had been about Ben! I rushed over and checked my camera to find what would be my favorite shot from the trip, setting a great precedent for the next six weeks of travel.

            The Oakley Pro Bali was held here June 18 to 29, 2013, because it is a great wave for high-performance surfing, allowing for aerial moves, big turns, and getting barreled. But surfing the break in darkness is a different challenge. It was hard to see the waves comingthey just pop up in front of you, then you got to swing and go. If you look into the lights you go blind until your eyes adjust again.

            Shooting from a Jet Ski, in the dark, Hennings and the water patrol put their experience to the test.

            Hennings decided to push the limits of his Canon 1DX and rely solely on the ambient light from massive stadium lights, set up at the nearby hotel. The lighting was very difficult to capture. I was limited to my exposure and film speed. I was able to push the ISO 12800. I have never used this setting before, but the conditions forced me to it. I was really quite happy with the results.

"It used to bother me that mainstream America is so out of touch with how progressive the level of windsurfing is now. But popularity means more crowds, which equals less fun."

            , seen here on an unknown route in Labyrinth Canyon along Utah's Green River. My goal on this trip was to learn how to trad climb and go into the unknown, says Woods, whose background is in bouldering, sport, and competition climbing. The feeling of being a beginner again was humbling, but I had some of the best to teach meMatt Segal, Alex Honnold, John Dickey, and Renan Ozturkand they did just that.
           </p>
           <p>
            With learning to climb comes learning to fall. The best part of the trip for me was falling on double 00 TCUs [protective gear placed in the rock] for the first time," recalls Woods, who lives in Boulder, Colorado. "As I was falling, I placed my hands over my head in mid-air, just waiting for the gear to rip and for me to hit the ground. Luckily, the pieces held and I survived.

            of this journey along Utah's Green River. The team kayaked the river and concentrated on two areas Serbo had climbed and scouted on the previous trip. We were looking for a high concentration of unclimbed routes per location. Photographically, I wanted to highlight the routes these guys put up, while giving it a scene of place.

           <p>
            Looking to capture the canyon and river, Serbo set up on a nearby pillar to shoot Woods. He had to battle dust and limited light due to narrow canyon walls. When the light was really good on the canyon rim  we were completely in the shade. This affected timing for shooting and gave us roughly an hour in the morning and evening of great light, he says.

            "This is an amazing route in a very unique cave hidden low in the gorge, says Siegrist. The route begins with some very overhanging and gymnastic climbing through mostly good holds, then it pulls the roof and finishes on this immaculate headwall of blue limestone." Siegrist, who lives out of his van parked mostly in Colorado, has been climbing for the last nine years. "This was the first hard route I have climbed in Europe on my first European climbing trip," recalls Siegrist. "Hopefully Ill be back when the water is warm enough to jump in!"

            "When I first saw this cave I knew immediately that it was going to yield a pretty wild top-down perspective," recalls Ladzinski. The trio kayaked to the location, and Ladzinki set up above Siegrist, who had hung a static line from nearby anchors. It gave the ultimate birds-eye perspective of the route he was trying. I used a basic pair of extended painter's poles to boom out from the wall to get the shotit was an exciting perch."

            After returning to their boat they discovered the boat had a hole. We rowed hardand laughed harderand were only mere inches from the surface of the water when we got back to the shoreline, says Ladzinski. "I thought we were going to have to swim and that would be bad for all of the camera gear in the boat! That sort of adventure makes it a better memory somehow, you laugh about it while it's happeningand for years to come. In some ways, its the best part of the job."

            While ski touring, McMillan and friends hiked 30 minutes up from the highest traverse in South Bowl to make sure they were alone. Revelstoke has a perfect combination of incredibly deep snowfalls, endless and easily accessible backcountry terrain, and a dedicated group of riders and friends to shred with, says McMillian, a Calgary, Canada, native who skied on the last three Freeride World Tours. I have skied all over North America and have never found better extreme skiing training grounds than we have here in Revy.

There are typically only a handful of sunny days in Revelstoke, so any day the forecast is for sun, I try to get out to shoot.

            Snow ghost trees dot the alpine slopes and Creary used them to frame his photo. Those trees added depth and texture to the image. I set up on the side of the cliff band, and to the side of McMillan, so I could showcase his amplitude and keep the background nice and clean. The duo shot this flip before sunset crept in. He stomped the flip clean, first go, and I was stoked with the image, says Creary.

            Falling wasn't an option, was the thought running through the mind of big-wave surfer and waterman

            as he rode this wave. Teahupo'o is truly one of the wonders of the world. Ive been making an annual pilgrimage to there for the past 17 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last week's swells were particularly largethe largest in recent memoryat the wave break just off Tahiti, which beckoned many of the world's best big-wave surfers. From his home in Oahu, Hawaii, Healey had monitored a complex storm system that spawned off of Antarctica. When the storm was 48 hours out and still looked massive, he booked his flight.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a very special wave for me because it was the largest I have ever ridden at Teahupo'o. It took a culmination of experience from my years there to ride it successfully, says Healy. But with the huge waves come huge risksand some surfers ended up in the hospital. After I caught this wave, I got on the Jet Ski and towed my friends into some waves and ran safety, he recalls. You can't get too greedy. I got what I had come for that day.

            . "At 11 a.m., the first tow-in set came in with a 15-foot swell, which is too big to paddle. After that, the swells increased and picked up. By the end of the day, we saw a couple of sets come in at 25 feet."
           </p>
           <p>
            Pompermayer watched and photographed Healey catching this massive wave. Mark Healey was towed into the perfect position with the exact speed he needed to set him up for this insane wave, says Pompermayer. This trip was fantastic because we had two big-swell days. It was so crowdedall the big riders from around the world showed up for this swell. It was a challenge to get a good shot on the boat because of the amount of boats and Jet Skis in the area, but I found it exciting.

            Whistler has North Americas best lift-accessed terrain, and many of the worlds best athletes come here to push their limits, says Treadway. I moved to Whistler 18 years ago. The biggest change is that back then you knew everyone, and if you didn't, they didn't live here.

            Facing mediocre snow conditions, Krabbe focused on the challenging terrain and set up underneath a cliff. This photograph was the second time Dan hit the cliff. The first time, I asked him to kick a lot of slough off the cliff, so he would be in the air with the falling snow. However, there was so much snow falling that you couldn't see him. The second time we opted for as little snow as possible, and it worked out perfectly, says Krabbe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I love using color to add to the emotion of the shot, so the blue coloring is partially a postproduction technique. We were also shooting on the shadow side of Whistler Mountain and looking up into blue skies, says Krabbe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Krabbe finished the competition in second place and walked away knowing Whistlers terrain better. I learned a lot from working with both Dave and Dan Treadway. Together they catch a huge number of magazine pages every year, so they know light, terrain, and photography almost as well as many photographers.

            It was an incredible moment. Then he disappeared into the spray of the barrel. It was one of those hold-your-breath kind of moments, to see if he would make it out. I kept shooting and was thrilled to see him reappear. Everyone who saw this ride knew Shane had just scored the ride of the year, no doubt, Pompermayer says.

            "Come on arms, do your stuff!" was the thought running through climber

            's mindas she climbed this hundred-foot route after a long day on the weathered sea cliffs of Maine.Findlay started climbing on some boulders just above the water; climber Alex Honnold is seen below her. The trip was a stopover after a North Face team expedition to climb sea cliffs in Newfoundland.

            "The sea cliffs in Maine were quite smalla hundred feet. The wall in Newfoundland was probably 1,500 feet," says Findlay. "But the cliffs in Maine are right above the water, so that makes it feel very dramatic and intense.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I actually learned how to climb on the sea cliffs of my own country, so it was really cool to visit some other sea cliffs on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean," says the British climber who now lives out of cars and suitcases. "Often trips aren't about how good the climbing is, but the adventures you end up having getting there."

After a soggy shoot in Newfoundland, the trio stopped in at Acadia National Park to climb. The cliff is called Great Head. I'm not sure of the name of the route or if it had ever been climbed. We were just psyched to finally monkey around after weeks in the rain, recalls Kemple.

            To capture the steep angle and water and to keep the belayer in the frame, Kemple rappelled from the top of the cliff. I climbed without a shirt on to work on my tan, jokes Kemple.

            were in-bounds but had hiked about 20 minutes up above the Roca Jack lift into a zone where very few people go. We had two feet of powder, and then the sun came out and began creating those awesome formations on the lake, Davenport recalls. Timing is everything in the mountains, and we timed this shot perfectly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Davenport has been hosting events and ski camps at the resort for the past 13 years. "Portillo is truly one of the world's most unique and special ski destinations, he says. There is no town there, just a gorgeous, old hotel at the foot of the lake high in the Andes, which caters to all types of skiers and boarders, from families to freeriders. I bring my kids there every season because it's such a kid-friendly mountainthey can't get lost!

            When we first got there, the lake was all open water, then it slowly changed into this abstract formation, says Pondella, who was in Portillo to ski and shoot with Davenport. I had photographed in Portillo before, but never had this particular shot in mind. It was not until this trip that we watched the lake transform like it did."
           </p>
           <p>
            Pondella and Davenport shot the entire day without getting the particular frame they had in mind, due to the terrain. The two had to wrap the shoot in order to catch a bus and make a flight home. As we were skiing down to the bottom, I looked over and saw this one patch of snow with the lake behind it and shouted to Chris, Thats our shot," Pondella says. "This was the last shot of our trip, and for sure the best one as it all came together exactly as I had envisioned earlier in the day."

            "A big challenge was the weather. It changed from sunny with blue skies to cloudy and over-shiny conditions within minutes. Everybody was motivated to get shots," recalls Richard. In a controlled event environment it can be difficult to capture unique photographs. "I had two approaches. First, the pipe in Laax is quite known for images with the round restaurant in the background, so I wanted to avoid that angle; The second approach was more graphic. While shooting, I was trying to get the images as clean and organized as possible. I think when you are spontaneous you get the best shots."

            Getting to the top of a climb that you put your heart and soul into is always less satisfying than going through the process of being able to do it, says climber
            <strong>
             Jesse Huey
            </strong>
            , seen here free climbing the challenging Red Dihedral route located an hour-and-a-half hike from his doorstep in Boulder, Colorado. Huey had attempted this route over eight days in January 2013. When I saw that several holds had been broken, it took way more effort to figure out the route than what I had originally anticipated, says Huey of the sandstone conglomerate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even on cold winter days like this one, it was still too hot to climb in direct sunlight, so timing had to be just right. Below where this photo was taken was a bit of climbing so difficult that if it was even remotely too hot, your shoe rubber would not stick to the friction of the wall, recalls Huey, whose climbing partner
            <strong>
             Josh Wharton
            </strong>
            was bundled up in down jackets on belay below him. "Then when the shade hit, we had less than an hour to climb before we couldn't feel our fingers."
           </p>
           <p>
            On the day that he actually completed the climb, Huey went to yoga the night before and spent an hour warming up in the gym before hiking out to the climb. It actually became very stressful because of a looming raptor closure for the area that went into effect January 31, says Huey. I finally finished on January 31. That felt really great.

            . And shooting images gives you the best seat in the house for all the sports action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping pace with Huey kept Dickey challenged as he was planning the photographs he wanted to capture. That day conditions were too hot for success in direct sunlight, which was very fortunate because I got to shoot Jesse trying extra hard, right as the shade line was creeping up, says Dickey. I had seen the lighting effect previously on that wall and was hoping the timing would work out as it did.
           </p>
           <p>
            After watching Huey work the tough route for a few days, the right elements aligned. The lighting was all natural and timing alone allowed it to come together. I had sat and watched the shadow line several days before and timed it out with Jesse's ambitions, recalls Dickey.

Lopez was competing in the first event of the Freeride World Tour on Mount Mackenzie, near Revelstoke in British Columbia, Canada, in January 2013. "I could see a part of the terrain, but not everythingbut I knew the mountain face, so didn't matter to me."

           <p>
            In the middle of his run he had to drop a massive cliff, but he had looked at the spot for a long time and knew exactly what to do when he got there. "I got third place, so I guess I had a good run. The snow conditions were so good."

            knew the shot he wanted to capture. "The light was beautiful due to the very cold air and a very low sun. I knew that skier Julien Lopez, aka the Flying French Man, would go big, straight off the starting gate for his first Freeride World Tour contest in 2013, says Carlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            I positioned myself right on the edge of the face to be able to shoot Lopez in the air to give a dynamic angle to the photo. I wanted to capture the competition venue visible under his skis, with Julien literally jumping into the clouds. His athletic body position gives a lot of dynamic energy to the shot, and the clouds give a sense of remoteness and elevation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carlier battled bitter conditions throughout the competition. That day was very cold, -35C/-31F on top of Mount Mackenzie. With the extreme freezing conditions it was pretty hard to operate my Nikon D800 control wheels and buttons with big gloves, so I had to take them off to make the shots, recalls Carlier.

            Racing a pending storm in the otherworldly landscape, Ladzinski and crew climbed the Mrdalsjkull Glacier as dark clouds rolled in. As evening approached and the sky took on a purple haze, Ladzinski used a split-neutral density filter to help retain his exposure and darken the sky in the mixed lighting. Bad weather generally makes for the best photographs, says Ladzinski. Dramatic and foreboding clouds made for the perfect sky and the overcast weather, which only made the blue glacier that much more vibrant.

            In February 2013, Collins was photographing at Hawaiis famed Pipeline break. "That day it was big, rogue Pipeline. Whether shooting in the water or on land, there is always something new to learn, fear, and respect," says Collins, who has shot several seasons at this wave. "It was between the surfers' Pipe comp and the bodyboarders' Pipe comp, so the best of the best were out there."

           <p>
            Collins captured this shot of an unknown bodyboarder taking on a wave that no one else rode. What is known is that the wave crashedit shook the ground when it broke, and it broke directly on him, he says.

            Sometimes it can make you feel a bit sick to witness these moments," Collins says. "I struggle with that, especially when Im in the water, too, but its my job to document it. I just want these guys to be able to go home safe, to their loved ones, at the end of the day."

            At this moment I was thinking how radical it was going to be to swing out onto that dagger of ice, recalls climber

            , seen here on a new route called the Angel of Fear in Utahs Santaquin Canyon. The moves going out to the dagger are not all that difficult physically, but you should still be heads up so you dont skate off, notes Adamson, a 15-year ice-climbing veteran. After I weaseled in some good rock protection the climbing seemed mellow.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a mixed-climbing route. First the climber ascends a steep rock roof, then he or she committs to this ice traverse. I strive to find routes that have big ice daggers and to climb naturally with gear. This route has natural gear placements for cams, nuts, etc., says Adamson, who lives at the base of Utahs Wasatch Mountains and works as a climbing and canyoneering guide in Zion National Park in the summer.

            of the ice dagger that had formed a few hundred feet above. Watt had photographed in the region before, under different conditions. The previous year, in this spot, several tons of ice had cascaded down the entire wall. This was a first ascent, so we weren't quite sure what to expect or whether the ice would even allow things to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            To capture this shot, Watt set himself at the same height as Adamson by equalizing an ice screw and bolt above and behind himself. I really wanted to give an idea of the position Scott was inthin ice and little gear with this crazy dagger just hanging out in spaceand for me that translates into working my way in close with a wide-angle lens." Racing against waning light, Watt worked carefully as Adamson climbed. I would wait for Scott to get into dynamic, angular positions that somewhat mimicked the geometric form of the ice. I was hoping to create an attraction of sorts between the climber and dagger.

On this day the conditions were perfectpowder with a low risk of avalanches. I didnt even notice the pillows on the way down, says the Alaska native who now lives in Girdwood. There are several pronounced chutes at the bottom of the face with large sections of rock between them, so I was pretty focused on finding my exit.

            Krueger hiked up the ridgeline and positioned himself to capture Smith. This was his second turn down the face and he already had plenty of speed, as he made a big left-hand turn into the perfect spot to capture the photo, says Krueger. Its always a challenge trying to assess the snowpack and make sure that we make safe decisions. On this day, everything came together perfectly.

I got to the bottom of the wave and looked up and saw the  meanest wall of water I've ever seen. Being inside the barrel was  so loud, then it turned quiet. It gets so peaceful a split second before it turns into a life-or-death situation." The Sunset Beach, Hawaii-based surfer is a true adventurer who rides waves for the love of it, not for sponsors. "Then I popped up and had never been happier."

            After packing up at the end of the day, Kurvin saw this set of waves breaking. I made a mad dash to get the camera out and lens cap off just in time to capture this. I stayed low to frame the beach, water, and sky," says Kurvin. "I love Pipeline in the evening; the green glow of the lip and yellow sky tends to make the photograph look almost three-dimensional.

            Setting up the shot took quite a while because it is such a technical feature with a narrow landing that the skier cannot miss," says photographer Reuben Krabbe. "I wanted to be sure the photo was worth James's risk attempting the line.

            Krabbe says the biggest challenge of this photo was lining up everything for a one-time shotand getting to this angle without making it more dangerous. "I skied to the bottom of the chute, and climbed up the side, and tried to not disturb James's run out, says Krabbe.

            Working with the ambient light, Krabbe captured the tone of the overcast weather that day. All the lighting is natural. I love capturing the way things look and feel, realistically," he notes. "Using flash on a feature like this could make for a poppy, exciting image; however, that would sacrifice the cold, organic, overcast feeling of the day."

            to ski the north facing Son of Apocalypse couloir. We had no idea what to expect going in. We hadn't heard of anyone skiing the route yet this season, which is part of the fun and adventure, says Havell. It was extremely cold, a minus 20F start, and since we were on the north side on a cloudy, stormy day, it stayed chilly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Son of Apocalypse is a more challenging run early in the winter season, but its northern position also provided the team some protection from the elements. We made two rappels and one small rock jump out the bottom to the exit apron and leapfrogged down the run," says Havell, who is based in Jackson and has climbed up and skied down ambitious mountains around the world.
